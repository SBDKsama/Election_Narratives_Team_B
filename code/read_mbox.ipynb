If you want to be a part of this team of supporters, chip in $5 or whatever you can to get your name on the map! Get on the map We have a lot of maps here at Bob Casey HQ, but this one might be our favorite. In 2020, Bob spent a week in front of his map of Pennsylvania breaking down the election. The stakes were high, and Bob used his expertise to help shed some light on what was happening. Then in 2022, Bob got out his map again to help keep track of the vote count in our Senate and Gubernatorial races until they were called for Senator Fetterman and Governor Shapiro. In 2024, were using our map to show just how many people are with us as we work day in and day out to re-elect Bob to fight for us in the Senate. Every name thats on the map proves that we have what it takes to win in November and its not too late to get yours up there. Donate now to join our team of supporters on the map! Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue.

I wouldnt exactly say Im calm about 2024. Mitch McConnell is trying to take back the Senate, and if he does, Republicans will cut Social Security and Medicare, pack the courts with extreme right-wing judges, and make it harder to vote. The only way we can stop them is by protecting Democratic incumbents like Bob Casey who arent afraid to stand up to Republican extremism. Heres what I know: the PA Senate race is going to be one of the countrys most expensive and competitive, and we need to do everything we can to make sure Bob Casey wins. Is there anything you can give to Bobs campaign right now? Lets not forget that in 2016, Donald Trump won the state by just over 40,000 votes. Yes, PA has had some big victories since then, but its also seen razor-thin margins in swing counties and a fight to turn out voters in Democratic hubs like Philadelphia. Pennsylvania is as competitive as it gets, and with the Senate majority and the White House depending on it, we cant take anything for granted. If were going to protect our Democratic Senate majority, our coalition to re-elect Bob Casey in 2024 has to be even bigger and better than PA saw in 2020 and 2022. It wont be easy, but its what we have to do to win, and I know its possible. Will you chip in whatever you can to Bobs campaign today?

Then in 2022, I pulled out the map again to break down Pennsylvanias vote tallies until my friends Senator John Fetterman and Governor Josh Shapiro officially won their historic victories. Now, the map is back and its better (and bigger) than ever and were covering it with the names of supporters from all across the Commonwealth.

So I'm personally asking: Will you split $5 or more right now between my campaign and Bob Caseys to make sure we have the resources to fight back against GOP attacks, protect this seat, and keep the Senate blue?

After that, were required to publicly report everything weve raised in the last three months.

When we file our report, it will show support from veterans, teachers, small business owners, health care workers, and more. It will show how were building a hard-working team that has Bobs back as we fight to keep our Commonwealth from flipping red. As for our opponent? David McCormick has been busy these past few months cozying up to out-of-state Wall Street billionaires and fake electors. Its clear that hes out for himself, while Bob focuses on helping working families across Pennsylvania. Look, this race is personal for all of us but its also the toughest election of Bobs career. A new poll shows our lead is slipping, and we could face hundreds of millions of dollars spent to defeat Bob and take away our Democratic Senate and White House.

That\\'s why were teaming up to launch our \"Battle for the Battlegrounds\" fundraising push, because we need to win all three of our races to hold the Senate and the White House.

Apparently, the MAGA Republican machine couldnt find a single Republican in Massachusetts to run against me so they brought in someone from Rhode Island who will have the backing of the GOP and special interest groups. This much is clear: Were up against national Republicans who are desperate to take back the Senate and pass Trumps agenda. Were up against their rich buddies who are trying to stop us from taxing the wealthy, regulating big banks, and making our government work for working people. Its going to take a strong grassroots movement to compete and win. Can you please split a donation of $5 or anything you can to support my re-election campaign andBob Casey's work? We need to respond to my opponents campaign launch with the strongest amount of grassroots donations to protect our Senate majority. Donate Now Im proud of the progress weve accomplished for Massachusetts families so far like lowering the cost of hearing aids, passing a new tax on massive corporations that were paying $0 in taxes, getting student loan debt canceled, securing billions in funding for projects like an electric bus fleet and infrastructure repairs, and so much more. But theres plenty more to do for working people in Massachusetts and across the country. Weve got to bring down the cost of housing. Put child care within reach for all working parents. Protect our Commonwealth from the climate crisis. Take power away from powerful interests like Big Pharma, Big Oil, and big banks and put it in the hands of working people which means we need to root corruption out of Washington. And Ive got the most sweeping set of anti-corruption plans since Watergate. This election is about who our government works for and its about defending our democracy and our basic freedoms. Im fighting to keep our Senate majority because if Republicans win any more power, theyll restrict abortion accesseverywhere, even in blue states that have passed abortion protections like Massachusetts. Theyll threaten voting rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act theyll reward the rich and powerful, and embolden an extremist base across the country. So Im staying in this fight to stop MAGA extremism, continue standing up to powerful special interests, and make real change for working people. Are you with me? Please respond to my opponents announcement with a donation of $5 or anything you can to support this campaign andBob Casey.

I knew I had some supporters from my congressional campaigns that I could count on, but beyond that it was a shot in the dark. One thing I knew for sure was that whether this was a 2-way race, a 3-way race, a 27-way race, whatever I was going to need the support of a huge grassroots team behind me. Over the last year weve built that team, with close to 150,000 individual donors. And now we know: Sinemas out. This race is a head-to-head between me and Kari Lake. And we've got to expand out that grassroots team and build a coalition here in Arizona that can defeat her. I believe that we can. But I cant do it alone. So today, Im asking you, very humbly, to make a donation to my campaign. Please, split a $5 or $10 donation between Bob Casey and my campaign. Whatever you can afford can help us build the team thats going to win in Arizona. Your support is critical to defeating Kari Lake and holding our Senate majority. Donate Now Thanks a lot for this.

I am so grateful to my fellow Texas voters and grassroots supporters like you for entrusting me with this honor I will not let you down. I'm ready to outwork Ted Cruz to win this thing because the stakes of this election are too high not to. From voting rights to abortion, our freedoms are under attack. Everyday costs are still too high. Simply put: Texans cannot afford six more years of Ted Cruz. Thats why this campaign is so important. Two recent polls showed us tied with Cruz, and I know we can win this race but I need you with me to do it.

But don't worry I've been an underdog my whole life. I know what it takes to beat the odds and win a tough fight. I'm a 4th generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas by a single mom who sometimes worked two jobs to make ends meet. I never knew my dad but thanks to my community of teachers, coaches and counselors at the YMCA, who helped my mom, aunt and uncle raise me, I had the opportunity to chase my version of the American Dream. Without them, I never would've made it to the NFL, gone to law school, become a civil rights lawyer, served in the Obama Administration, or run against a 22-year GOP incumbent and won, becoming the first Democrat to ever represent TX-32 in Congress. And thanks to them, I am where I am today: the official Democratic nominee who has the chance to become Texas first Black Senator. The chance to finally defeat Ted Cruz and give Texans the committed leadership we deserve. With experts calling Ted Cruz the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country and two polls showing us TIED, the only thing that could hold us back is resources. Its true that everything is bigger in Texas, and this campaign is no exception. Its going to take the biggest grassroots movement Texas has ever seen to beat Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz already has more than $6.5 million in the bank to attack me with, so please: Will you chip in $5, $10, or any amount to me and Bob Caseybefore midnight tonight to make sure I have the resources to fight back against Ted Cruz's attacks, reach voters across Texas, and win?

For years, Bob has been fighting for working Pennsylvanians, standing up for the economic freedom of workers, and bringing investments and jobs home to Pennsylvania. Much of this was possible thanks to the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which David McCormick, our mega-millionaire opponent, said he would have opposed. The truth is, as a hedge fund CEO, McCormick got rich by outsourcing jobs to China and India while laying off workers in Pennsylvania. He even said he doesnt care if American manufacturing jobs are shipped overseas. McCormick will fight for large corporations and his Wall Street backers in the Senate, which is why the national GOP is all-in to flip this seat. We have to fight back.

Republicans could spend hundreds of millions of dollars in PA to flip this seat red. Thats why Im doing one of these classic emails asking you to chip in a few dollars to support Senator Bob Caseys re-election campaign, because we need to do everything we can to help him win. We all know that Pennsylvania will be a top presidential battleground this year. Its part of both Democrats and Republicans paths to victories. That puts an even bigger spotlight on this Senate race, where Mitch McConnell and national Republicans are all in for the mega-millionaire hedge fund exec (thats McCormick, who I mentioned earlier). This is going to be a tough race, and we just cant afford to lose this seat. Can you chip in to Bobs campaign today? Every dollar counts! Donate to help re-elect Bob Casey This race could determine the Senate majority. We have to win.

So I wanted to share a story with you: I grew up on my familys farm and I still work the land today. That explains a lot about me. When I was a kid, I lost three fingers on my left hand in a meat grinding accident while working in our familys butcher shop. I dont even remember putting my hand therebut I damn sure remember pulling it out. Heres why Im telling you this: Just like my $12 flattop haircut and my dirt-stained t-shirts, my background is a big part of the reason I remain grounded and focused on defending Montana. With all the chaos in Washington (especially now), you need somebody who will roll up their sleeves and get to work. Im pretty different from most people who end up in the U.S. Senate. Im a proud dirt farmer trying to do whats right for the people in my state and across the country. But Im in the toughest campaign of my life, and I need your help more than ever. So heres the part where I ask: Can you split a critical donation between my reelection campaign and Bob Casey? Your donations directly power everything we do, and it would mean a lot to me personally if you chipped in today. If you've stored your info with ActBlue Express, we'll process your contribution instantly: Donate $15 Donate $25 Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate $250 Other amount You dont need ten fingers to know right from wrong and you can bet Ill spend every single day trying to do right by working families, farmers, students, and veterans here in Montana and across the country.

If we listed all of our favorite things about our Commonwealth, this poem would be too long. 67 counties in total make up the Keystone State. From Erie to York to Bucks each and every one makes us great. Well end it there and let you enjoy Valentines Day, but believe us when we say that Bob will never stop fighting for PA.

We want to be sure were on the same page about WHY we cant let David McCormick and the GOP win. So heres a quick fact sheet about our opponents disastrous record and why hes just not right for PA: David McCormick *David McCormick celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade and supports a ban on abortion nationwide, without exceptions for rape or incest. *McCormick hired one of Trumps fake electors to run his Super PAC and has had multiple fake electors on his campaign payroll. *McCormick laid off Pennsylvanian workers and shipped jobs overseas to China and India. *McCormick lives in Connecticut and often takes a private jet to campaign events in Pennsylvania. *McCormick is a mega-millionaire hedge fund executive who has already spent $1 million on his own campaign. Thats a pretty bad track record, and we cant let someone like that defeat Bob Casey.

Im respectfully asking if youll make a contribution to support my friend Bob Caseys re-election campaign. Let me tell you why. Bob is a fierce advocate for working families in Pennsylvania and across the country and, right now, hes facing the toughest campaign of his career. This is going to be one of the closest Senate races of 2024, and the stakes couldnt be higher. Mitch McConnell and national Republicans have zeroed in on Pennsylvania as a must-win Senate race in their mission to take back the majority. Theyre preparing to do everything they can to regain Senate control by coming after Bob and flipping Pennsylvania red. Not only that, but Bobs opponent, David McCormick, has the ability to self-fund. That means PA could see even more political spending than it did in 2022 and I dont think you need me to remind you that they spent a record-breaking $381 million in PA last time around. We need to stand with Bob to keep a real Pennsylvanian in the Senate, and defend our Democratic majority. Bob is relying on this team to have his back, so I hope youll chip in a few dollars to support him today. Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue. Donate $15 Donate $25 Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate $250 Other amount Thank you for your support. I truly appreciate it. All my best, Tammy Duckworth This email was sent to Jengabuilding90@gmail.com.

He was a healthy man in his early 50s who kept a vegetarian diet and worked out every morning. One day, he ruptured his Achilles tendon playing basketball before a business meeting with his colleagues. A few weeks later, he passed away. Why am I telling you this? When I decided to step up and run for office for the very first time ever, it was on the anniversary of his passing. I made that decision with the knowledge that I didnt know how to run a campaign. I had never done it before. Looking back on that first campaign in 2016, I realize I was in mourning. As I traveled up and down our state, people shared their stories of challenge and triumph with me. They inspired me and gave me the motivation to keep going. Im just as inspired by Delawareans today as I was then, and Im so grateful for the hope and healing they unknowingly gave me. Its why I plan to continue to be an advocate and a fighter. The reality is that many deaths from blood clots are preventable. Because of my own experience and the countless stories Ive heard on the campaign trail, Im spearheading a bipartisan effort in Congress to raise awareness and recognize March as Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Awareness Month. It would mean so much to me if you could be a part of this effort. Will you add your name to become a citizen co-sponsor today?

No matter how many lawsuits they file or lies they spread, the GOP can't change it: Abortion is going to be the driving force at the ballot box this November. And that's why Rick Scott and his campaign are absolutely spiraling. He knows his record on choice is nothing short of abysmal. That's why he's panicking, and calling me a liar to the press every chance he gets. Friend, let me make this clear: Rick Scott co-sponsored a nationwide ban on abortions, just like the statewide one that his radical friend Ron DeSantis signed here in Florida last year. I am unapologetically pro-choice, and his accusations don't scare me. I will always fight to protect reproductive freedom.

With my son and daughter-in-law's permission, I felt comfortable sharing this in a recent interview I did with MSNBC because to me, it matters that folks understand just how personal reproductive care is. Millions of families across our country have pursued IVF as a route to grow their family. It is so important that people know the leaders they elected support them in their journey to have a child. And when we look at this election, folks need to think about what extreme Republican leaders say versus what they do. They can say they support reproductive care, but we saw their reaction to the Dobbs decision. And they can say they support IVF, but GOP Senators just voted against a bill to protect it. They've shown us who they are, now it's time for us to believe them. This is a moment for us to decide whether we will fight for access to reproductive care like IVF or back down to anti-abortion politicians. I'm in this fight because if MAGA Republicans in Congress get their way, we know they'll come after birth control next. You can count on me to fight tooth and nail to protect IVF as Senator.

I grew up knowing very few role models that looked like me in government, so I made it my mission to change that. When I set my mind to something, it gets done. As I reflect during Womens History Month, I can't help but to look back at my younger self and think of what helped me get here. It's the support from so many women - role models, family members, friends, and so many more who helped me feel empowered to lead in Congress, and now lead in the Senate.

This Black History Month, I have been reflecting on so many of the Black leaders and visionaries from the past and who are living among us today. Throughout history, Black Americans have made invaluable contributions to this country despite facing barriers, adversity, and injustice every step of the way. One of the barriers that we, as Black Americans, have faced is not having sufficient representation in our government and even today, we still have a long way to go. I'm going to tell you a little bit more about why representation matters, but first, can I ask that you make a contribution of $10 to my campaign? [ CHIP IN [ In its 234 year history, the United States Senate has had 2,003 Senators but only three of them have been Black women. Let me be blunt and say: that is not enough. Representation in our government is so important. When we see ourselves reflected in positions of leadership and influence, it sends a powerful message that our voices are valued. And it also ensures that our government is working for everyone, not just a select few. The historical nature of this campaign is not lost on me, but I am not in this fight just to make history. I am in this fight to make sure that every Delawareans voice is heard and every perspective is represented. In order for all of this to be possible, we need to hold the Senate majority. Trump, McConnell, and the MAGA machine are preparing to throw everything they have at Delaware to flip our state red. This would spell serious trouble for our majority.

Beyond his professional accomplishments, many throughout Delaware knew him first and foremost as a friend, mentor, confidante, and trusted advisor. Put simply, everybody knew Ted Blunt and Ted Blunt knew everybody. He was a guiding light whose influence extends far beyond the memories he and I shared. But for me, Ted Blunt was Dad. Dad was my hero. His passion for education, commitment to our community, and unwavering belief in positive change have left an indelible mark on my values and principles. He was also one of my inspirations to run for office. Check out my personal reflection on my Dads life and legacy in this video. [ Watch the Video [ Without his support, I would not be here today.

Each message and memory shared is a beautiful reminder of the positive impact he had on our state and on all the lives of those around him. Just knowing how many lives he touched during his time on Earth has given me comfort during this darkest of times. The memories of Dad remind me of why Im running to keep fighting to make the world a better place and improve the lives of others. Dad was always a fighter known for getting into what John Lewis used to call good trouble, and I have tried to embody his fighting spirit as a Congresswoman. Dad always said: Some have sight. They open their eyes and see what is. And some have vision, they close their eyes and see the future. While it is painful to close my eyes and see the future of this campaign without Dad cheering me on at the finish line, I want you to know we are going to run hard and we will honor his memory by winning. I am eternally grateful for the support my family and I have received over these past few weeks. Your belief in the values Dad stood for reinforces my commitment to public service, and your kindness reminds me that, even in the midst of sorrow, there is a community ready to lift each other up.

Im a born-and-raised Missourian who watched with horror when Josh Hawley raised his fist at insurrectionists outside the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, then ran out the back door when they stormed the building later that day. Ive seen communities across my home state torn apart because of cowardly politicians like him and Im not willing to sit on the sidelines in this election. So before I ask you to split a donation of $5 or whatever you can today between my friend Lucas Kunces campaign and Jacky Rosen to replace Josh Hawley, please let me tell you why: Most of my family is from a town in Missouri called Ste. Genevieve, about 60 miles south of St. Louis. Ive watched their community go downhill for years. While corrupt politicians shipped jobs overseas and voted to give handouts to Wall Street and their corporate allies, everyday people just trying to survive in the place they call home ran out of money and opportunities. Our leaders abandoned them and Josh Hawley is the perfect example. Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in the out-of-touch culture wars that only divide us all so he can get more and more power for himself. Thats what we saw on January 6th, 2021. Hawley raised his fist at rioters outside the Capitol because he thought it would make himself look strong. But when sh*t got real, he ran out the back door like a coward away from the same people he was claiming to support just hours earlier. Whats even more ridiculous? Since that day, Hawley has desperately tried to convince all of us that hes the authority on what it means to be a man in this country. He even published a whole book about it earlier this year: Well when I think about manhood, I think about courage. And thats not something you can write a book about. Missouri is the Show Me State. Courage is something you have to show us. Thats why Im supporting Lucas Kunce for Missouris U.S. Senate seat. As a born-and-raised Missourian who joined the Marines to serve the community that took care of him growing up, Lucas has already shown us that he knows the true meaning of courage. Lucas knows courage is about standing up to the powerful and working to rebuild our state. And he knows real leaders fight to empower everyday people and secure our future for generations to come not for their own power or profit. So friend, if you want to be told about manhood, some guy wrote a book about it. But if you want someone to show you real courage, please join me in supporting Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate by splitting a donation of $5 between his campaign and Jacky Rosen today. Lucas worked hard over the last year to put Missouris Senate race on the map. From calling out Josh Hawleys blatant corruption to building a coalition of working people, pro-democracy organizations like End Citizens United, and local leaders across Missouri he is Democrats best chance to defeat a GOP incumbent and flip a U.S. Senate seat this election cycle. Hes building a truly grassroots campaign to defeat Hawley and take back power for everyday working Missourians just like my friends and family in Ste. Genevieve. It has never been more important to elect a warrior for working people like Lucas Kunce to the U.S. Senate. So friend, will you join me in supporting Lucas Kunce by splitting a donation of $5 between his grassroots campaign and Jacky Rosen today?

Dark-money groups like the Koch network are spendingbig in Nevada to defeat me because Senate control hinges on this race. If we're going to fight back, we really can't afford to miss a single fundraising goal. That's why you might be seeing more messages like this from my team as we prepare for our critical FEC end-of-quarter fundraising push next week.

That's why the GOP has personally named me a top target for defeat. Donald Trump just held a rally here for his handpicked candidate, and Republican super PACs are spending record-breaking amounts to attack me on the airwaves. But while they're in this fight for their megadonor friends, I'm in this fight for you, friend. This campaign has always been about advancing the Dignity of Work for all our families, and today's primary is the first major test for our grassroots movement. So with Senate control on the line, we can't afford to back down now. That's why we need to raise $500,000 by the time polls close at 7:30 p.m. so we can defeat whichever rich guy wins the GOP primary and keep up our shared fight in the Senate. So please, friend, I'm personally asking: Will you split $5 now or our average donation of $5 between my campaign and Jacky Rosens so we can win in Ohio and Nevada and defend our Senate majority?

My friend Jacky Rosen grew up in a working-class family as the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants and the daughter of a World War II veteran. Today, I have the great privilege and responsibility of serving as the first Jewish Senate majority leader in our nations history, and Jacky is the only Jewish woman currently serving in the U.S. Senate. Dont ever tell me that things cant change. Our humble origins and shared Jewish faith are at the core of what motivates our work together in the Senate. Every day, were fighting to make progress on the real issues Americans face: lowering everyday costs for families, combating hate and discrimination, and restoring reproductive freedom. But the GOP has a different vision for America, which is why theyre trying to defeat Jacky and enact their toxic agenda. Right now, Republicans are targeting Jackys seat in battleground Nevada as the key to Senate control. Mitch McConnell personally selected an extreme GOP opponent to run against her, and he just set a new fundraising record. Donald Trump has been campaigning aggressively in Nevada to rally support from his MAGA base. We cant let the only Jewish woman serving in the Senate stand against the full force of the GOP alone. But with polling showing Jacky tied neck and neck with her opponent right now, she needs all the help she can get to fight back. Thats why Im personally reaching out to ask for your support: Will you please join me in supporting Jacky's reelection campaign by giving $5 or more now?

If youre already with me, will you split a donation between me and Jacky Rosen to help power our grassroots campaigns? All the way back in 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels, a pastor and State Senator from Mississippi, was elected as the first Black U.S. Senator. Since then, we've come a long way as a country. But representation like our democracy is a work in progress, and I believe we can do better. Black Americans have long faced far too many obstacles like, discrimination, lower pay, and higher job instability not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents. I'm ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfectunion for my boys and every kid in Texas. But unlike Ted Cruz, I don't have corporate special interests footing the bill for my campaign. To win, I need a massive movement of grassroots supporters to step up and join me in this fight.

Im a born-and-raised Missourian who watched with horror when Josh Hawley raised his fist at insurrectionists outside the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, then ran out the back door when they stormed the building later that day. Ive seen communities across my home state torn apart because of cowardly politicians like him and Im not willing to sit on the sidelines in this election. So before I ask you to split a donation of $5 or whatever you can today between my friend Lucas Kunces campaign and Jacky Rosen to replace Josh Hawley, please let me tell you why: Most of my family is from a town in Missouri called Ste. Genevieve, about 60 miles south of St. Louis. Ive watched their community go downhill for years. While corrupt politicians shipped jobs overseas and voted to give handouts to Wall Street and their corporate allies, everyday people just trying to survive in the place they call home ran out of money and opportunities. Our leaders abandoned them and Josh Hawley is the perfect example. Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in the out-of-touch culture wars that only divide us all so he can get more and more power for himself. Thats what we saw on January 6th, 2021. Hawley raised his fist at rioters outside the Capitol because he thought it would make himself look strong. But when sh*t got real, he ran out the back door like a coward away from the same people he was claiming to support just hours earlier. Whats even more ridiculous? Since that day, Hawley has desperately tried to convince all of us that hes the authority on what it means to be a man in this country. He even published a whole book about it earlier this year: Well when I think about manhood, I think about courage. And thats not something you can write a book about. Missouri is the Show Me State. Courage is something you have to show us. Thats why Im supporting Lucas Kunce for Missouris U.S. Senate seat. As a born-and-raised Missourian who joined the Marines to serve the community that took care of him growing up, Lucas has already shown us that he knows the true meaning of courage. Lucas knows courage is about standing up to the powerful and working to rebuild our state. And he knows real leaders fight to empower everyday people and secure our future for generations to come not for their own power or profit. So friend, if you want to be told about manhood, some guy wrote a book about it. But if you want someone to show you real courage, please join me in supporting Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate by splitting a donation of $5 between his campaign and Jacky Rosen today. Lucas worked hard over the last year to put Missouris Senate race on the map. From calling out Josh Hawleys blatant corruption to building a coalition of working people, pro-democracy organizations like End Citizens United, and local leaders across Missouri he is Democrats best chance to defeat a GOP incumbent and flip a U.S. Senate seat this election cycle. Hes building a truly grassroots campaign to defeat Hawley and take back power for everyday working Missourians just like my friends and family in Ste. Genevieve. It has never been more important to elect a warrior for working people like Lucas Kunce to the U.S. Senate. So friend, will you join me in supporting Lucas Kunce by splitting a donation of $5 between his grassroots campaign and Jacky Rosen today?

Bob Casey Our Democratic Senate majority is hanging on by a thread, friend. With West Virginia off the map, the GOP only needs to flip ONE seat to deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell, roll back every bit of progress that Democrats have made for working families, and enact their disastrous agenda. My seat in Nevada is one of the most likely to flip red along with my friends Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, so I need to ask you for an important favor today. Will you split a donation of $5 between our three campaigns today? Mitch McConnell and his dark-money allies are coming after the three of us with everything theyve got. If they succeed in flipping our three states red, we have no path to defending our Senate majority OR keeping control of the White House. Its that simple. So were working together to win this Battle for the Battlegrounds - and were counting on you to join us, friend. If you want to prevent the nightmare of another Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Senate, the best thing you can do is donate to help us reach our $50,000 goal before midnight tonight: Will you chip in $5 or more now split between my campaign, Tammy Baldwins, and Bob Caseys so we can win our battleground races in Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania?

Ill tell it like it is: Democrats are in BIG trouble. FIRST: Democrats just barely kept Nevada blue in the 2022 Senate race winning by only 7,928 votes. THEN: A recent poll showed Jacky Rosen NECK AND NECK in this years race a race that analysts at FiveThirtyEight say is likely to decide Senate control. NOW: The GOP is ALL IN on Nevada as a top target, and Mitch McConnells handpicked puppet candidate set a new fundraising record to defeat Jacky. If Jacky loses in Nevada, extreme Republicans will take back the majority, and they will make it their TOP priority to strip away basic rights and pass a nationwide abortion ban and the GOP is already gearing up to drop millions and millions of dollars to defeat Jacky so they can do it. Folks, winning this race starts with raising the resources to prepare for the tough fight ahead of us, and right now, Jacky is way short of her daily fundraising goal. So please, rush $5 now so Jacky Rosen can win Nevadas pivotal battleground Senate race, defend our Democratic majority, and protect our fundamental rights from the GOPs attacks. The ball is in your court now. Thank you for stepping up at this make-or-breakmoment. James Carville - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

My friend Jacky Rosen grew up in a working-class family as the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants and the daughter of a World War II veteran. Today, I have the great privilege and responsibility of serving as the first Jewish Senate majority leader in our nations history, and Jacky is the only Jewish woman currently serving in the U.S. Senate. Dont ever tell me that things cant change. Our humble origins and shared Jewish faith are at the core of what motivates our work together in the Senate. Every day, were fighting to make progress on the real issues Americans face: lowering everyday costs for families, combating hate and discrimination, and restoring reproductive freedom. But the GOP has a different vision for America, which is why theyre trying to defeat Jacky and enact their toxic agenda. Right now, Republicans are targeting Jackys seat in battleground Nevada as the key to Senate control. Mitch McConnell personally selected an extreme GOP opponent to run against her, and he just set a new fundraising record. Donald Trump has been campaigning aggressively in Nevada to rally support from his MAGA base. We cant let the only Jewish woman serving in the Senate stand against the full force of the GOP alone. But with polling showing Jacky tied neck and neck with her opponent right now, she needs all the help she can get to fight back. Thats why Im personally reaching out to ask for your support: Will you please join me in supporting Jacky's reelection campaign by giving $5 or more now? Every dollar will make a critical difference in keeping Nevada blue, defending our Senate majority, and ensuring that Jacky and I can both continue making progress for the American people.

Apparently, the MAGA Republican machine couldnt find a single Republican in Massachusetts to run against me so they brought in someone from Rhode Island who will have the backing of the GOP and special interest groups. This much is clear: Were up against national Republicans who are desperate to take back the Senate and pass Trumps agenda. Were up against their rich buddies who are trying to stop us from taxing the wealthy, regulating big banks, and making our government work for working people. Its going to take a strong grassroots movement to compete and win. Can you please split a donation of $5 or anything you can to support my re-election campaign and Jacky Rosens work? We need to respond to my opponents campaign launch with the strongest amount of grassroots donations to protect our Senate majority. Im proud of the progress weve accomplished for Massachusetts families so far like lowering the cost of hearing aids, passing a new tax on massive corporations that were paying $0 in taxes, securing billions in funding for projects like an electric bus fleet and infrastructure repairs, and so much more. But theres plenty more to do for working people in Massachusetts and across the country. Weve got to bring down the cost of housing. Put child care within reach for all working parents. Protect our Commonwealth from the climate crisis. Take power away from powerful interests like Big Pharma, Big Oil, and big banks and put it in the hands of working people which means we need to root corruption out of Washington. And Ive got the most sweeping set of anti-corruption plans since Watergate. This election is about who our government works for and its about defending our democracy and our basic freedoms. Im fighting to keep our Senate majority because if Republicans win any more power, theyll restrict abortion access everywhere, even in blue states that have passed abortion protections like Massachusetts. Theyll threaten voting rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act and theyll reward the rich and powerful and embolden an extremist base across the country. So Im staying in this fight to stop MAGA extremism, continue standing up to powerful special interests, and make real change for working people. Are you with me? Please respond to my opponents announcementwith a donation of $5 or anything you can to support this campaign and Jacky Rosen. Grassroots supporters like you have helped defeat the GOP and special interests in the past, and I need your support again as we take on this new fight.

The story below is a special one about my faith and how I first got involved in politics. This one means a lot to me, so I hope youll take a moment to read it. But if you dont have the time to take a look right now, could you still chip in $5 to help me keep Nevada and the Senate blue? Friend, My career in public service began in 2016, when I was recruited to flip a competitive House seat blue. I was serving as the president of Nevadas largest synagogue, and looking back now, that was incredibly fitting because my Jewish faith and values have always been at the very core of my work in Congress. In fact, my decision to run for public office was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam to leave the world a better place than how we found it. Im so proud of the progress we've made in the years since. And in the face of growing antisemitism, attacks on reproductive freedom, and threats to tear down our democracy, I'm as committed as ever to making positive change happen. ButIneed your help. Right now, polls are showing me locked in a dead heat withMitch McConnell's handpicked candidate who just set a major GOP fundraising record in the race that will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking: If you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities we love, will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and keep the Senate blue?

I'm ready to outwork, outraise, and out-organize Ted Cruz to win this thing, and with multiple polls already showing me TIED with Ted, I'm confident we can do it. But I also know Cruz is backed by wealthy mega donors who will spend whatever it takes to keep him in office. Thats why I need you with me: Please, will you chip in $5 or whatever you can spare to help reach my $1 million General Election Kickoff goal? Every dollar you can spare will power our people-powered movement through Election Day so we can defeat Ted Cruz and deliver better, stronger leadership for the people of Texas. Will you help kick our campaign off in a huge way by donating $5 or more to me and Jacky Rosen right now? Im a fourth generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas by a single mom. My mom was a public school teacher and sometimes worked two jobs to make ends meet. Thanks to my family and a strong support system of teachers, coaches, and the good folks at the YMCA, I earned a full-ride football scholarship to Baylor University and then went on to play in the NFL. But playing football was never my only dream from a young age I knew I wanted to help people. So I became a civil rights attorney to defend what I believe is our most fundamental right: the right to vote. I proudly served in President Obamas administration before I came home to Dallas, where my wife, Aly, and I are now raising our family. I ran for Congress in 2018 because I wanted more kids in North Texas to have the opportunity to achieve their version of the American dream. I also saw that our democracy was in peril and wanted to be part of protecting it. No one gave me a chance in that race, but I beat the odds to defeat an 11-term Republican incumbent. Since then, I'm proud to have been named the most bipartisan member of the Texas delegation. Now, Im ready for my next challenge: firing Ted Cruz and being the voice all Texans need in the Senate. We're already better off than we were in 2018, with experts calling Cruz the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country, and two polls in a row showing us tied. I'm not saying it will be easy, but with you on my grassroots team, I know we can get it done, friend. Thats why Im asking you to chip in right now to become a General Election Founding Donor and help reach our ambitious $1 million goal. We need an unprecedented grassroots movement to unseat Ted Cruz, and Im counting on you to be a part of it.

If the Senate flips red this year, hell have free rein to enact his dangerous agenda and devastate our countrys future. If history shows us anything, its that the GOP wont go down without a fight. They spent over $55 MILLION trying to flip Nevada red last time. And during Jacky Rosens first Senate run, Trump even resorted to attacking her personally and calling her childish nicknames. We have to prepare for any dirty tricks hell throw our way this time. We must do everything it takes to keep far-right Republicans out of power, Team Rosen. Thats why its absolutely critical that we reach todays Rapid Response goal and we need your help specifically. Will you stand with Democrats today by making your first $5 donation to Jacky Rosens campaign before midnight? We cant waste another moment while Trump and MAGA Republicans surge ahead.

Recently, there was a panel discussion called Adam Schiff Justice at the Conservative Political Action Conference (known as CPAC). And trust me, it was not designed to be a flattering reference. Then, MAGA House Republican leader Elise Stefanik spent her speaking time at CPAC attacking me. She called me a Russia hoaxer and denied the January 6th insurrection. And only a few hours later, Donald Trump took the stage at a campaign rally in South Carolina, where he once again lashed out at me. He called me a sleazebag for investigating his blackmail threat to bribe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. And more. All of this happened in one day. With just one day until our primary election, we can only expect more attacks from here.

With voters casting their primary ballots right now, we're running out of time to raise the resources we need to start the general election off strong.

This came after CNN called Ted Cruz the most vulnerable Republican Senator in the country, and experts at Roll Call agree that this is our best shot to win in Texas! It couldn't be more clear, friend we can win this race. But now, Republican extremists are ready to spend millions to prop up Ted Cruz. They know just how vulnerable Cruz is, and they'll spare no expense to reelect him and take back the Senate Majority. That's why it's so important that we hit tonight's fundraising goal of $100,000 to keep this momentum going: Please, will you rush $5, $25 or whatever you can spare to help me and Jacky Rosen defeat Ted Cruz?

Apparently, the MAGA Republican machine couldnt find a single Republican in Massachusetts to run against me so they brought in someone from Rhode Island who will have the backing of the GOP and special interest groups. This much is clear: Were up against national Republicans who are desperate to take back the Senate and pass Trumps agenda. Were up against their rich buddies who are trying to stop us from taxing the wealthy, regulating big banks, and making our government work for working people. Its going to take a strong grassroots movement to compete and win. Can you please split a donation of $5 or anything you can to support my re-election campaign and Jacky Rosens work? We need to respond to my opponents campaign launch with the strongest amount of grassroots donations to protect our Senate majority. Im proud of the progress weve accomplished for Massachusetts families so far like lowering the cost of hearing aids, passing a new tax on massive corporations that were paying $0 in taxes, securing billions in funding for projects like an electric bus fleet and infrastructure repairs, and so much more. But theres plenty more to do for working people in Massachusetts and across the country. Weve got to bring down the cost of housing. Put child care within reach for all working parents. Protect our Commonwealth from the climate crisis. Take power away from powerful interests like Big Pharma, Big Oil, and big banks and put it in the hands of working people which means we need to root corruption out of Washington. And Ive got the most sweeping set of anti-corruption plans since Watergate. This election is about who our government works for and its about defending our democracy and our basic freedoms. Im fighting to keep our Senate majority because if Republicans win any more power, theyll restrict abortion access everywhere, even in blue states that have passed abortion protections like Massachusetts. Theyll threaten voting rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act and theyll reward the rich and powerful and embolden an extremist base across the country. So Im staying in this fight to stop MAGA extremism, continue standing up to powerful special interests, and make real change for working people. Are you with me? Please respond to my opponents announcementwith a donation of $5 or anything you can to support this campaign and Jacky Rosen.

From an early age, my family ingrained in me the value of hard work, showed me how unions built the middle class, and instilled in me the belief that every worker deserves the right to bargain for better pay and benefits, a safe workplace, and a dignified retirement. My grandmother worked the graveyard shift at the Nabisco cookie factory nearly her entire adult life and she was able to retire with dignity because she was a member of the Bakery and Confectionery Workers' union (the sweetest union). My uncles were firefighters whose union made sure they had the security of decent pay and workplace protections. I worked myself as a cocktail waitress at Caesars Palace to help pay my way through college, and I was a proud card-carrying member of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas. That's who I am and where I come from and thats why I've always fought for issues like strengthening workers rights to unionize, securing paid family leave, raising the minimum wage, and lowering everyday costs for families. But to keep up my fight for working families, I need your urgent help. Mitch McConnell personally recruited a far-right, anti-union candidate to defeat me, and then a MAGA billionaire and shady dark money groups started pouring millions into Nevada to prop up his campaign. Now, polling shows me locked in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. That's why I have to ask you directly, friend: Will you chip in $5 or more right now to help me defend my seat in Nevada, keep the Senate blue, and continue making much-needed progress for working families?

I know we have what it takes to protect this battleground seat and defend the Senate for Democrats but only if we have the resources we need to defeat the GOP. That's why we need to build the strongest grassroots team possible as soon as possible. But I'm still looking for another 25 people from 02120 to step up, including you.

And I'm all in to protect my battleground seat in Nevada so I can keep up the fight for affordable health care, reproductive freedom, and the issues that matter most to working families. But I need people like you by my side to win. Here's why: CNN ranks me as one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot, which is why Mitch McConnell has personally recruited a far-right Republican to defeat me. And polling has already shown me 2 points down in the race that will likely decide Senate control. If I'm going to fight back and defeat the GOP here in Nevada, it's critical that we show the full strength of this grassroots team right from the start. That's why I have a personal request for you, friend: I'm looking for 100,000 people to step up and become Election Year Founding Donors by midnight tonight, and I'm counting on you to be one of them.

Now, they know that the path to Senate control once again goes right through Nevada, so they're doing whatever it takes to finally flip this battleground red. Already, a shady MAGA billionaire dumped $2 MILLION into this race to prop up McConnell's handpicked candidate, and we know this is just the beginning. That's why we're on a mission to build the strongest grassroots team possible as early as possible to fight back and defend this seat. So please, I'm counting on your immediate grassroots support: Will you give $5 or more now to become an Election Year Founding Donor, power this reelection campaign to victory in Nevada, and defend our Democratic Senate majority?

Jacky Rosen Can I tell you the story of how I first got involved in politics, friend? While serving as the president of Nevada\\'s largest synagogue, I was recruited to run in a competitive House race to help flip a red seat blue. Looking back, it\\'s incredibly fitting that this was my entry point to public service because my Judaism helps guide much of my work in the Senate today. In fact, my decision to say \"yes\" and run for public office in the first place was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam which means to leave the world a better place than how we found it. Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I\\'m proud to serve Nevada and our country.And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I\\'m as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help. Mitch McConnell\\'s handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I\\'m humbly asking: If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you if you\\'re with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we lovewillyou chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

And its why I\\'m proudly fighting to bring positive change to communities in Nevada and across the country. But right now, I need your help.

And just last month, he returned to Las Vegas for a campaign rally and won Nevadas GOP caucus by a landslide. 2.Mitch McConnell only needs to regain two seats to take back the Senate and he personally recruited Sam Brown to defeat me. 3.Sam Brown is an anti-choice extremist who is being funded by MAGA billionaires and shady dark-money groups like the Koch network. And if that wasn't bad enough, he just set a new GOP fundraising record against me! With Trump and the GOP determined to flip Nevada red, I need your urgent grassroots support to fight back. But right now, Im still very short of my $20,000 midnight goal and it looks like you havent given yet.

The 2024 Senate map is the toughest one Ive ever seen. Our razor-thin majority is hanging on by a single thread, and theres no question that Mitch McConnell and his extremist cronies will use every trick up their sleeves to snatch back power. The GOP is coming at us with full force and with experts saying that Nevada could once again decide Senate control, theyre zeroing in on Jacky Rosen as a TOP target for defeat. Polling shows the Nevada Senate race in a statistical dead heat! Its not looking good, friend. Jacky needs to raise another $7,198 by midnight tonight to fight back against GOP attacks and fuel her campaign forward but the ONLY way she can get there is with your immediate grassroots support. So PLEASE, will you chip in $5 or more now? Democrats won in Nevada by less than 1% in 2022, making it the closest Senate race in the entire country. Now that they have a second chance at winning in Nevada, Republicans arent going to leave anything up to chance and theyre already pulling out all of the stops to flip this seat. If Jacky loses in Nevada, McConnell and his far-right posse will take back the majority and enact their dangerous, out-of-touch agenda. We CANNOT let this happen. In my expert opinion, we CAN win this race and keep control of the Senate but that starts with raising the resources, today, to prepare for the tough fight ahead. So please, friend, Im asking you one more time before the midnight deadline: Will you chip in now as much as you can spare to help Jacky win in Nevada and defend our majority?

If youre already with me, will you split a donation between me and Jacky Rosen to help power our grassroots campaigns? All the way back in 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels, a pastor and State Senator from Mississippi, was elected as the first Black US Senator. Since then, we've come a long way as a country. But representation like our democracy is a work in progress, and I believe we can do better. Black Americans have long faced far too many obstacles like: discrimination, lower pay, higher job instability not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents. I'm ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfectunion for my boys and every kid in Texas. But unlike Ted Cruz, I don't have corporate special interests footing the bill for my campaign. To win, I need a massive movement of grassroots supporters to step up and join me in this fight. Please, will you chip in $5 to split between my campaign and Jacky Rosen's to defeat Ted Cruz, become the first Black Senator from Texas, and be the leader Texans deserve?

If I'm going to fight back and defeat the GOP here in Nevada, it's critical that we show the full strength of this grassroots team right from the start.

Please, will you chip in $5 or more now to help me keep Nevada and the Senate blue? Rosen for Nevada - 2024 Election Year Founding Donor In Nevada's last Senate race, the GOP spent MILLIONS and came within less than a percentage point. Now, they know that the path to Senate control once again goes right through Nevada, so they're doing whatever it takes to finally flip this battleground red. Already, a shady MAGA billionaire dumped $2 MILLION into this race to prop up McConnell's handpicked candidate, and we know this is just the beginning. That's why we're on a mission to build the strongest grassroots team possible as early as possible to fight back and defend this seat. So please, I'm counting on your immediate grassroots support: Will you give $5 or more now to become an Election Year Founding Donor, power this reelection campaign to victory in Nevada, and defend our Democratic Senate majority?

Ill tell it like it is: Democrats are in BIG trouble. Ive been in politics for a long time, and youd be hard-pressed to find a map as tough as ours this year. Were defending the most delicate Senate majority Ive ever seen and Mitch McConnell and his extremist cronies are bound to use every trick up their sleeves to snatch back control. The GOP is coming at us with full force, and theyre going ALL IN on Nevada as a top target because they know this battleground is key to Senate control. And with polling already showing Jacky Rosen locked in a dead heat, its not looking good. Nevada is a must-win seat to protect the Senate again in 2024, but Jacky is falling behind her end-of-month fundraising goal, so can you please chip in $5 ASAP? Democrats barely won in the Silver State by a slim 7,928 votes last year, the closest Senate race in the countryso you can bet that Mitch McConnell and his far-right posse have a bone to pick. They have a massive, dark-money war chest behind them and are gearing up to drop millions and millions of dollars attacking Jackys reputation. The stakes couldnt be more clear. If Jacky Rosen loses in Nevada, Mitch McConnell and GOP extremists will take back the majority and make it their TOP priority to strip away our basic rights and pass a nationwide abortion ban. But its not all doom and gloom, friend. In my expert opinion, we can win this race and keep control of the Senate. That starts with raising the resources to prepare for the tough fight ahead of us. So, ahead of Jackys first end-of-month deadline of 2024, Im begging: Will you please join me and rush $5 so we can win this pivotal battleground state? The ball is in your court now.

A huge part of our grassroots outreach efforts is running digital ads, because this competitive primary will be determined by how many persuadable Democratic voters were able to reach over the next few weeks. Digital ads lets us find and communicate with folks who might not have heard our message yet maybe all theyve seen is a thousand TV ads for my multi-millionaire opponent. Those are voters we need to reach, Jenga, and that becomes even more challenging when we miss fundraising benchmarks like last nights Digital Ads goal. Id hate to have to cut back on our voter outreach plans this week if we cant turn things around. Raising an extra $5,000 today would do wonders towards getting us back on track and helping us continue to fund our digital ads, so would you please consider donating $25 right away?

He even admitted that hes willing to spend whatever it takes, regardless of what that number is, to win this race.

Thats because hes self-funding his campaign to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and using his personal wealth to dominate the air waves. In fact, he just broke the all time NATIONAL spending record for self-funding a Senate primary campaign. Running for the U.S. Senate is expensive, Jenga, but this is getting ridiculous. We must show that people power can overcome a big bank account. But, to do that, Angela needs YOUR help and she needs it NOW. Angelas got an incredible grassroots team, and shes counting on all of us to help her win this competitive primary and ultimately win this race in November.

Outmaneuvering that kind of spending will take the biggest, best-organized grassroots outreach effort this state has ever seen, and the only way we can bank on having the needed resources is by crushing this $75,000 digital goal.

A lot of Hogans momentum comes from the perception that hes a moderate voice in an otherwise extremist, out-of-touch GOP. But Hogans veto record tells a very different story, Jenga. In fact, were about to give you 5 clear examples proving that Larry Hogan is wrong for Maryland and would be just one more rubber stamp for the GOPs agenda in the Senate, but before we do that: Will you please chip in $25 just $5 for each reason listed below to help us take on Larry Hogan and win this critical battleground race? Donate $25 Other Amount Here are 5 examples proving that Marylanders deserve better than Larry Hogan: He vetoed a $15 minimum wage. He undercut workers by vetoing legislation that would have allowed them to deduct union dues from state income taxes. He vetoed a bill to restore voting rights to more than 44,000 previously incarcerated Marylanders. He vetoed common sense gun legislation mandating background checks. He vetoed legislation to increase access to reproductive care by increasing the number of abortion providers in Maryland. Larry Hogan isnt fooling anyone, Jenga, and we cant afford to let him represent Maryland in the U.S. Senate. Will you please pitch in $25 so we can boost our Maryland-first message, win this critical election, and defend our narrow Senate majority?

I knew I had some supporters from my congressional campaigns that I could count on, but beyond that it was a shot in the dark. One thing I knew for sure was that whether this was a 2-way race, a 3-way race, a 27-way race, whatever I was going to need the support of a huge grassroots team behind me. Over the last year weve built that team, with close to 150,000 individual donors. And now we know: Sinemas out. This race is a head-to-head between me and Kari Lake. And we've got to expand out that grassroots team and build a coalition here in Arizona that can defeat her. I believe that we can. But I cant do it alone. So today, Im asking you, very humbly, to make a donation to my campaign. Please, split a $5 or $10 donation between Angela Alsobrooks and my campaign. Whatever you can afford can help us build the team thats going to win in Arizona. Your support is critical to defeating Kari Lake and holding our Senate majority.

Im still feeling optimistic though, because we didnt miss our mark by a lot but a race this close is a game of inches, so its critical to our success that we dont let this take the wind out of our sails as we head towards our first FEC filing deadline of 2024 at the end of March. A strong start to this month would get us right back in the swing of things, and nothing could get us back on track faster than a couple of big fundraising days. So heres what Im asking: Would you please consider making a quick grassroots donation to help us get back in a groove? Donate $25 Other Amount The reality is that my opponents dont have the grassroots support we do, but what they do have is personal wealth. And a lot of it. In fact, one of my opponents has already spent tens of millions of dollars of his own money on ads to boost his campaign. But this grassroots team has been breaking fundraising records left and right ever since we first launched, and winning this race is going to require that we maintain that pace. Hitting fundraising goals allows us to hire and train more staff, ramp up outreach, and puts us in prime position the closer we get to Election Day. The flipside is that falling short means missing out on critical opportunities to connect with voters. Our campaign is built on small-dollar donations, not million-dollar checks. Can you please chip in just $25 right away so we can get back to breaking records, crushing fundraising goals, and setting the stage to WIN this competitive race?

Asking you for contributions is my least favorite part of running for office. If it were up to me, Id much rather spend my time talking face-to-face with Marylanders about the issues they care about, or chatting about topics close to my heart, like education, reproductive rights, and public safety. But the bottom line is that high-profile battleground Senate races like ours are won with resources (a fact that my opponents know better than anyone). Grassroots fundraising allows us to run impactful TV and digital ads, cover campaign expenses, and reach prospective voters from all walks of life.

I normally try to keep my emails on the shorter side, but this is a long one. In my defense, I have a lot to say! Ive outlined some of my key priorities in this campaign and our fight to build a better Maryland. So, if you can, I hope you take a few moments to read it through! But if youre in a hurry, you can support my campaign for the U.S. Senate here, then come back and read this whenever youve got some extra time! Donate Put People First This campaign isnt about Angela. Its about you the people of Maryland and the issues that you care about most. Putting people first on the campaign trail looks like: Listening instead of just talking, having face-to-face conversations, and meeting Marylanders where they are (whether thats Wegmans, at your front door, or just out on the sidewalk!). In the Senate, putting people first means standing up to those who undermine the health and safety of our communities. It means making sure that Marylanders can live, work, learn, and prosper in the state we call home. Thats been my mission since I entered public service nearly thirty years ago. I wont back down now. Lead from Experience I believe that Marylanders deserve a Senator whos walked a mile or two in their shoes. I understand firsthand the problems faced by regular Marylanders, because I am one unlike my multi-millionaire opponent! I grew up in a working-class home. My parents taught us to look after our neighbors and give back to our community. And as a working mom, Ive experienced challenges shared by so many families. I know what its like to worry about affordable childcare, public safety, and high-quality education. I know the enormous value of a supportive and close-knit community. Ive been there. Those experiences got me into public service in the first place, and theyre the reason Im still fighting to improve education, expand economic opportunities, and ensure working Marylanders have the tools they need to thrive. Tackle the Issues That Matter, Big or Small Maryland is made up of so many diverse communities. As a public servant, its my responsibility to understand the unique issues each one faces. For some, those are big-picture issues like climate change, affordable healthcare, or abortion rights. Others are concerned about issues that dont always make headlines, like flood readiness, broadband access, and clean water; veterans benefits; recycling programs; treatment for substance abuse and mental health; and addressing historic inequality. On hot-button and obscure policy issues alike, these issues matter to me because they matter to you. Together, well confront the obstacles that hold us back. Well go farther and do better for Maryland. Wow, Jenga! I said at the beginning of this email that itd be a long one I wasnt lying! If youve made it this far, thank you. I just have to make one final request. I need to overcome my opponents massive spending and win this ultra-competitive primary before I get to work for Maryland families in the Senate. Can I count on you to chip in $25 to help me pull ahead?

This has the potential to turn the 2024 election cycle entirely upside down, because the stakes couldnt possibly be any higher.

In case you missed it, heres whats been happening for the past week on the campaign trail and beyond: In Baltimore, we were joined by over 200 people for our 100 Men for Alsobrooks event. Thank you to our amazing host committee, including Congressman John Sarbanes, Congressman Kweisi Mfume, Senator Cory McCray, County Executive Johnny Olszewski for gathering such an incredible crowd on a Saturday morning. [IMG] We stopped by Su Casa Furniture store in Baltimore, where we had a great conversation with their manager Nick about how we can further support Baltimore residents and local businesses. By providing access to capital and investing in our communities, we can revitalize communities and small businesses across Maryland. [IMG] Angela stopped by Jinji Chocolates in Northeast Baltimore for some tasty treats. The founders, Jinji and Guy Fraser, collaborate with cacao farmers to ensure that they are paid equitable wages while preserving the land they grow their product on. We also discussed how important land and climate protection is to them and how their business model could be applied to other businesses across the country. [IMG] How wonderful it was to meet Monesha Phillips and to visit her store, Pandoras Box in South Baltimore, filled with whimsical trinkets and amazing little knick knacks. We are simply in awe of the creativity and the innovation that entrepreneurs like Monesha possess across Maryland. [IMG] While making our way around Baltimore, we stopped by Franchescas Empanadas Caf for lunch, where the empanadas were absolutely delectable and packed with flavor! The owner, Franchesca, saw the need for an empanada restaurant in Baltimore, and as a result, created a space for the community to gather for some good food. [IMG] We spent some time touring the historic Pennsylvania Ave Main Street in Baltimore. We had the pleasure of visiting the Pennsylvania Avenue Market, home to many wonderful, thriving small businesses. Its crucial we expand access to capital for minority owned businesses as they are pivotal to the success of our communities and local economies. [IMG] It was wonderful to celebrate Valentines Day at the ATU Local 689s annual Sweetheart Ball. Thank you to President Ray Jackson for inviting us to join the festivities! We are honored by your continued support! [IMG] Sunday morning, we worshiped with Congressman Kweisi Mfume and his super bad wife Dr. Mfume at the New Shiloh Baptist Church in Baltimore.

Its about health care, about our basic freedoms, privacy, and control over our own bodies. And, unfortunately, there IS a clear and present threat to abortion rights in Maryland. His name is Larry Hogan. Just look at Hogans own record on reproductive healthcare: *Vetoed a bill to relax restrictions on reproductive healthcare providers in Maryland *Vetoed funding to train healthcare providers to perform abortions safely *Vetoed a bill requiring health insurance companies to cover abortions with no costs to patients *Vetoed a bill to guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave for new parents And we cant forget that Mitch McConnell whos spent decades undermining abortion rights handpicked Larry Hogan to run in Marylands Senate race, going so far as to call him his \"best recruit of the cycle.\" Jenga, there are already FAR too many anti-choice Senators on Capitol Hill.

Before I tell you all about why I decided to run, I want to make you a simple promise: I will always take the time to learn from and listen to you. Ill work diligently every single day to make this community proud. The truth is, there arent that many people in the Senate who live and think like the people they were elected to represent. I know the people of Maryland should have a Senator who not only fights for them, but who also understands and shares their concerns.

She had one rule for her family: No complaints. Shed often say, If you don't like something, you go farther and you do better. That lesson lived on through my hard-working parents. They taught me what integrity looks like and to respect all work. Their example led me to run for office for the first time 13 years ago, right here in Prince Georges County. I fought to develop new economic opportunities, improve the health, safety, and security of our communities, and strengthen our education system. Im deeply proud of the things weve accomplished so far but in Washington, theres plenty of work left to do. With a little determination and a good attitude, I know we can go farther and do better for all Marylanders. There will be bumps on the journey ahead. But as I write this, theres not a doubt in my mind that well overcome them together. Jenga, if you can, will you chip in $25 to our historic campaign?

For people like me. When I was a child, I was diagnosed with a serious illness and spent three months in the hospital. When I got better, my grandparents, who raised me, began looking for an insurance policy that would cover me in the future. But they couldnt find such a policy because of my previous illness. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. They had to pay for my health care out of pocket and they had to make enormous sacrifices to do so all because I was a child labeled with those words: \"pre-existing condition.\" I got into public service because I saw my grandparents stay up late at night, worried sick that I would fall ill again and that they wouldn\\'t be able to afford my care. No one should ever have to go through that. Like 133 million Americans, I know what it\\'s like to have the label \"pre-existing condition\" attached to my care and before the Affordable Care Act was passed, many of us could be denied coverage. Now, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against someone based on their pre-existing condition. I championed health reform and fought to allow young people to stay on their parents insurance plan up to age 26. These policy changes have led to millions more Americans getting the health insurance they need. But if Eric Hovde flips this seat and secures the Senate majority for Republicans, the Affordable Care Act will be on the chopping block and countless Americans could find themselves in a place where insurance companies, once again, write all the rules. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take peoples health care away, which is why I\\'ve fought against Republican repeal efforts and why I will never back down. But I cant defend the hard-fought progress weve made without your help. So before the ACAs 14th anniversary, Im humbly asking: Will you make a donation to my reelection campaign to defend our Senate majority? Thats the only way well prevent Republicans from rolling back the progress weve made expanding access to affordable health care. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: CHIP IN $5 NOW CHIP IN $10 NOW CHIP IN $25 NOW CHIP IN $50 NOW CHIP IN $100 NOW ANOTHER AMOUNT I am not going to let anyone make me forget where I came from or why I got into public service in the first place. My experience has always inspired my work to do everything I can to make sure that every American has quality, affordable health care coverage and stand up against those who want to take it away. As long as you\\'re with me, I know we can overcome any challenge we may face on the road ahead and stop Republicans from taking away health insurance from millions of Americans once and for all.

Seeing others in the LGBTQ+ community demonstrate acts of courage by coming out, being themselves, and being public about who they are and who they love I came to realize that I could do both. I could run for office and be honest about who I am. Young Tammy Baldwin Thanks to the support of this incredible team, I was elected as the first openly gay Senator in our nations history. I understood that I needed to use this extraordinary opportunity to make a difference in people's lives. From lowering prescription drug prices to protecting same-sex marriage through the Respect for Marriage Act, Ive worked hard every day since to do just that. Thats why I first ran for office not to make history, but to make a difference. And folks like you supported me because you wanted to make a difference, too. Weve made incredible progress, but we cannot mistake our progress for victory. Republican-led state legislatures across the country continue to pass harmful legislation, especially targeting the transgender community and LGBTQ+ youth. A Republican Senate majority threatens to do the same at the national level. Its going to take all of us to counter these right-wing attacks so everyone grows up knowing they belong and that kindness and inclusion, not hatred and division, are American values. So, as my opponent and Republicans nationwide threaten to advance an extreme and hateful agenda, I'm asking you again: Will you help me fight back against the far-right extremists trying to undo our progress? Pitch into my reelection campaign today, and lets keep making a difference together.

And in just one week, our opponent flooded $2.5 million into Wisconsin to go up with self-funded TV and digital ads several weeks before our campaign planned to launch ads of our own. Look, whoever has more resources to spend on TV will likely win this election. That means we can't let Hovde and his right-wing allies control the narrative. We need to make sure voters know the truth now. After talking it through with Tammy and the team, we decided to increase our March advertising budget to go up with our own ads as soon as possible. The money wasnt in the budget, but I gave the green light anyway. I took a big risk here. Theres no doubt about it. But I was willing to bet that if I reached out and told the truth, our grassroots supporters would come through to help fill this unexpected hole in our budget. Thats the only way we can keep pace with the $20 million Hovde plans to spend. So, can I count on you to pitch in to Tammys reelection campaign today? Every dollar will help us close this budget gap so we can keep our new ads on the air and get Tammys message out to voters across the state.

Thanks for chipping in today, if you can. Were so grateful to have you on this team. Scott Scott Spector Campaign Manager Tammy Baldwin for Senate P.O.

Now, the real fight begins. I'm ready to outwork, outraise, and out-organize Ted Cruz to win this thing, and with multiple polls already showing me TIED with Ted, I'm confident we can do it. But I also know Cruz is backed by wealthy megadonors who will spend whatever it takes to keep him in office. Thats why I need you with me: Please, will you chip in toward my $1 million General Election Kickoff goal?

My mom was a public school teacher and sometimes worked two jobs to make ends meet. Thanks to my family and a strong support system of teachers, coaches, and the good folks at the YMCA, I earned a full-ride football scholarship to Baylor University and then went on to play in the NFL. But playing football was never my only dream from a young age I knew I wanted to help people. So I became a civil rights attorney to defend what I believe is our most fundamental right: the right to vote. I proudly served in President Obamas administration before I came home to Dallas, where my wife, Aly, and I are now raising our family. I ran for Congress in 2018 because I wanted more kids in North Texas to have the opportunity to achieve their version of the American dream. I also saw that our democracy was in peril and wanted to be part of protecting it. No one gave me a chance in that race, but I beat the odds to defeat an 11-term Republican incumbent. Since then, I'm proud to have been named the most bipartisan member of the Texas delegation. Now, Im ready for my next challenge: firing Ted Cruz and being the voice all Texans need in the Senate. We're already better off than we were in 2018, with experts calling Cruz the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country, and two polls in a row showing us tied. I'm not saying it will be easy, but with you on my grassroots team, I know we can get it done. Thats why Im asking you to chip in right now to become a General Election Founding Donor and help reach our ambitious $1 million goal. We need an unprecedented grassroots movement to unseat Ted Cruz, and Im counting on you to be a part of it. Please, rush a split donation of $10, or whatever you can spare, to help Tammy Baldwin and me win our Senate races this November. Thank you so much for being a part of my team. Your support has gotten me this far, and it's why I know we can win. Let's do this, Colin Allred P.O.

When I was young, I was diagnosed with a serious illness that resulted in three months in the hospital. When I recovered, my grandparents, who raised me, searched for an insurance policy that would cover me in the future. They wanted to make sure I was protected in case I got sick again. Unfortunately, they couldn\\'t find a policy that would cover me because of my previous illness. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. All because I had a \"pre-existing condition.\" My grandparents had to pay for my health care out of pocket, and they had to make significant sacrifices to do so. I saw my grandparents worry about me and how they would pay for my care. I got into public service because I believed no one should have to go through this. My story isn\\'t a unique one it\\'s an experience shared by 133 million Americans living with pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, people with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage. Today, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against someone based on their pre-existing condition. I championed that health care reform, and fought to pass my legislation allowing young people to stay on their parents\\' insurance plan until they turn 26. These changes have helped millions of Americans get the health insurance they need. But now, Republicans are attacking our health care and threatening the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. If Mitch McConnell and Republicans flip the Senate, they could roll back on our progress and take our country back to a place where insurance companies, once again, write all the rules. I fought against Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act before, and I will continue to defend it. But I can\\'t do it alone, Jenga. I need your help to keep up this fight in the U.S. Senate. Will you make a donation to my reelection campaign so I can keep up this critical work? I need your help to defend our Senate majority and prevent Republicans from rolling back the progress we\\'ve made expanding access to affordable health care.

Wisconsin is home to some of the most competitive elections in the country and Tammy Baldwins reelection race this year is shaping up to be no different. Last month, Senate Republicans threw their support behind Eric Hovde, the right-wing megamillionaire who is gearing up to enter Wisconsins Senate race. As soon as he launches his campaign, hell bring with him a campaign war chest fueled by at least $20 million of his own personal fortune. Thats the kind of cash that can tilt the scales when elections are won and lost by less than a percentage point. I know this campaign has what it takes to reelect Tammy Baldwin, defeat Eric Hovde, and keep Wisconsin blue. But we need to start building resources now to prepare to compete against Hovdes cash advantage so Tammys campaign can reach voters, fight back against Republican attacks, and mobilize Democrats across the state. None of that can happen without your support, which is why Im reaching out to you today: Before tomorrows end-of-month deadline, will you make a donation to Tammys campaign to help her keep Wisconsin blue? She cant defend this toss-up Senate seat without your help: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: CHIP IN $5 NOW CHIP IN $10 NOW CHIP IN $25 NOW CHIP IN $50 NOW CHIP IN $100 NOW ANOTHER AMOUNT Were getting dj vu with Republicans like Eric Hovde following Ron Johnsons winning strategy from 2010 when Johnson announced late in the cycle to avoid disclosing his personal finances for as long as possible and fueled his campaign with his own personal fortune, before defeating Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold. Together, we have a chance to make sure history doesnt repeat itself in 2024. Thanks for playing a critical role in Tammys campaign. Ben Wikler Chair, Democratic Party of Wisconsin P.O.

From the beginning of my campaign, I've counted on our grassroots team to fuel our efforts and fight back against MAGA extremists. But whether it's our well-connected, wealthy opponent Steve Garvey, the California GOP, or the watchful eyes of reporters, everyone will be scrutinizing our FEC report to gauge the strength of our campaign, Democrats overall chances of defending the Senate, and defeating Donald Trump. Reaching our FEC fundraising goal or falling short will produce one of two possible narratives that grassroots Democrats are doing everything possible to defeat Trump, or if were leaving the door cracked open for his return. We cannot fall behind. Jenga, Im ready to bring about meaningful change in the Senate. Im ready to build an economy that works for everyone. Im ready to strengthen our democracy with restored voting rights, stronger codes of conduct for Supreme Court justices, and campaign finance reform. Im ready to fight for universal healthcare and eliminate student loan debt nationwide. But all of these plans rely on us defending the Senate and defeating Trump in November and I can only do that with you by my side. Please, if you can, will you please pitch in $5 or any amount to my campaign for the U.S. Senate?

You see, I wasnt always the partisan lightning rod Trump has made me out to be. Earlier in my career, I dont think you could have found a member less likely to be subjected to Fox News misinformation and smear machine (you know, the one fined $787 million for lying about the election and Dominion Voting Systems). I co-founded the Democratic Study Group on National Security. I was a frequent presence on Sunday morning shows not talking about Trump but about foreign policy and intelligence matters. I spent far more time securing federal dollars for light rail, an early earthquake warning system, open space, and housing than I did conducting investigations. I believed the only way to hold the seat I had flipped from red to blue in the most expensive House race in the country in 2000 was by providing exceptional constituent service and bringing resources back home to my district. But my prior experience as a federal prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s prepared me in ways I never could have anticipated to fight back against Donald Trump measured where he was erratic, truthful where he was transgressive, methodical where he was maniacal. Its why I knew I could take on the fight when Speaker Pelosi asked my committee to investigate Trump in a formal impeachment inquiry, how I prosecuted his Senate trial, and how I helped lead the investigation of the Capitol insurrection on the January 6 Committee. I cant wait to close this dark chapter of our history by defeating Donald Trump once and for all this November, so Congress can return to some sense of comity, and we deliver even more concrete results for California and the American people than we did in the first two years of the Biden Administration. In order to do so, we have to hit our fundraising goal before tomorrows final mid-month deadline of this FEC quarter. In a little over 2 weeks, our books will close on the last three months of fundraising, and well file a public report. Everyone from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell and their allies will be pouring resources into battleground states and across the Senate map if our momentum falters.

I grew up on my familys farm, and Sharla and I still work that land today. In my opinion, being a farmer makes me a better senator. My background is a big part of the reason I remain grounded and focused on defending our Montana way of life. Because with all the chaos in Washington (especially now), you need somebody who will roll up their sleeves and get to work. Last time I ran, nearly $70 million was spent on the Montana Senate race. This time around, weve already passed that number: an eye-popping $120 million has been spent or reserved in advertising alone. Itll take a lot of support from this team to raise what well need to protect this seat. And if you know me, Im not the kind of person who likes to ask for money. But I bet Mitch McConnell would be furious if we showed him that a whole lot of grassroots power is stronger than his wealthy donors and super PACs will ever be. Lets be clear: This election isnt a sure thing. Experts say this race is a toss-up and rank Montana as one of the seats most likely to flip.

We took that message all over the Golden State and I couldnt be more grateful to every single one of you who lent me your support. Weve built the largest grassroots campaign in California Senate history. And we built it with a strong, diverse team of supporters and leaders from 18 statewide labor unions, to over 80% of Californias Democratic House delegation, to hundreds of state and local officials, to community leaders and activists. But our work is only just getting started. Every day from now until November, Ill be working to win Californians support. We need to defeat Garvey, defend our Senate majority, flip the House, and beat Donald Trump once and for all by reelecting President Biden. To get things done in the Senate, we cant have a Republican majority or worse, a second Trump term. Now that were matched up with another celebrity Republican for the general election, Trump and MAGA Republicans are even more likely to attack us.

I knew I had some supporters from my congressional campaigns that I could count on, but beyond that, it was a shot in the dark. One thing I knew for sure was that whether this was a 2-way race, a 3-way race, a 27-way race, whatever I was going to need the support of a huge grassroots team behind me. Over the last year weve built that team, with close to 150,000 individual donors. And now we know: Sinemas out. This race is a head-to-head between me and Kari Lake. And we've got to expand out that grassroots team and build a coalition here in Arizona that can defeat her. But its more than me. We need to defeat MAGA extremism across the country. We need to protect and expand the Democratic Senate majority and elect leaders who will abolish the filibuster and help deliver results for hard-working families. People like Adam Schiff. I believe that we can. But I cant do it alone. So today, Im asking you, very humbly, to make a donation to my campaign. Please, split a $3 or $10 donation between Adam Schiff and my campaign.

The most extreme right-wing MAGA Republicans in Congress and the media will have larger platforms. Big Pharma will prepare for greater windfall profits.

But luckily enough for both of us, hes been my favorite tennis partner ever since. Thats how we became Adam and Eve, and although we didnt meet in the Garden of Eden, our 29 years of marriage have been pretty incredible. Adam and Eve giggling candidly Adam is an amazing husband and father. And weve had some thrilling adventures together. Not all of them have been easy. But from the campaigns he lost to the sweet campaign victories, from his travels across the district for his congressional races to his statewide travels across California, our relationship has been a busy, fulfilling, and exciting journey. There are times it has been tough Ill admit, its hard to hear all the attacks and insults the former president and his cronies throw Adams way. But Adam is relentless in defending our democracy. Protecting the rule of law. Building an economy that works for everyone. Now that this Senate primary is just a few short days away, Adam is facing one of his biggest challenges yet. I know he can take it on hell face any challenge just the way he does when hes on the tennis court. Hell stretch, lace up his sneakers, and be ready for whatever comes his way.

At the time, we were fighting hard for LGBT rights and marriage equality for all. We have very similar values and became very good friends. And now he has been my congressman for years. He has been seen fighting all kinds of good fights and has proven himself to be someone who really stands up for democracy and stands up for America. In my own personal life, he has certainly proven himself as a friend and as someone who really listens and cares. When I needed someone to listen to me about our lack of effective stalking laws, he was the only one who listened. He met with myself and several other stalking victims several times. Domestic violence, sexual assault, threats to womens safety and well being all of these things. He listened. He cared. When my Alabama father, a very strong and outspoken Republican, needed someone to listen to him about ideas he had for improving the illiteracy rates, poverty levels and quality of life in Coosa County, Alabama, where I grew up, Adam Schiff was the one who invited my father to meet with him in his office in Washington, DC and listened and cared about everything he had to say.

Billy Crystal here. I cant tell you how worried I am about the dangers threatening our democracy. More than ever it is important to elect a Senator for California who will not only champion the essential values we all hold dear but who has proven he has the leadership skills we need to take on the big fights. Simply put, there is no one that I trust more than Adam Schiff to protect our democracy not to mention my firm belief that Adam will actually get things done as Californias U.S. Senator. Before I go any further, please join me in supporting Adams campaign for U.S. Senate by chipping in a small contribution. There is no shortage of challenges facing our state, from the lack of affordable housing and childcare to the need to make the economy work for people. And Adam is always there in every part of our state wanting to know, How can I help? Whether thats by walking the picket line in solidarity with striking writers and actors or leading the effort to hold Trump and his enablers accountable, Adam always takes on the most important fights hes someone we can always count on. From gun safety to lowering the cost of prescription drugs and fighting for our planet, Adam is constantly pushing to make our government work for the people especially in the face of continued Republican dysfunction. Thats why Im supporting Adam. California and the country cannot afford more failed leadership like that of ousted GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam played a key role in two of the most productive years in Congress recent history we need his leadership to make that kind of progress again in the Senate. Republicans have proven time and again that they are simply incapable of leading they only care about power and staying in the good graces of the twice-impeached, four-times-indicted, disgraced ex-president Donald Trump. Thats why Im working to help Adam build the largest grassroots movement in the history of California to make our economy work for everyone, and to elect Democrats up and down the ballot to deliver the majorities we need to make big, bold change. So Im personally asking: will you pitch in any amount to help elect Adam to the U.S. Senate, win Democratic majorities, and keep up these important fights?

Will you help my family celebrate his birthday by signing his birthday card and adding your well wishes? It would mean so much to him and Ill explain why below. SIGN THE CARD My father, Ed or as hes known to many, Boca Eddie taught me so many lessons while growing up. A proud veteran who left high school early to join the army at the end of WWII, he taught his two sons to respect those in uniform and to love our country. Here we are together at the WWII Memorial on the National Mall. Adam and his father Ed Schiff at the WWII Memorial in Washington DC As kids, we moved around a lot for his work. From Massachusetts to Arizona, ending up in the Bay Area when I was eleven. Through it all, my parents worked hard to make sure my brother Dan and I had good neighborhoods to live in and good public schools to attend. Even when times were tough and there were times he said we all needed to tighten our belts he made sure we gave back to others in our community. You see, public service and giving back were important values in our household. My parents believed in doing good for your community, being compassionate to everyone, and extending a helping hand to anyone needing one. Those lessons have resonated with me in my work to this day. They have led me to pursue criminal justice reform, to make housing the homeless a top priority, to attack discrimination head-on, and to ensure the rule of law is applied justly. I am who I am today because of my parents, and I know hes proud of the work I am doing each day to protect our democracy and make the world a better place. And oh yeah, it wont surprise you to know that he doesnt think much of Donald Trump. Without putting too fine a point on it he thinks the man is a putz. Another thing to know about my dad is that he calls it like it is. In fact, I remember telling him many years ago when he turned 80 and was campaigning for Obama in Florida that he had earned the right to speak his peace and not give a rat's ass if people didnt like it. He assured me that he hadnt waited until 80 to feel that way. So you can imagine how he is at 96! So to bring an extra big smile to his face on his 96th birthday, will you sign his birthday card today? SIGN THE CARD Thank you, Jenga.

He is always willing to offer help and support to those who need it. No matter where he goes, its the very first question he asks. How can I help? And he means it. Growing up, my dad would tell us stories about the people he'd met from our district, their concerns about their jobs, their families, and all of the things that they wanted to be different in our country the issues that mattered most to them. My first thought hearing those stories as a kid was always that it must be so hard to listen to them every day and have people expect so much from you as just one person. But my dad always told us that it was the best part of the job. The chance to hear people's struggles and honest concerns and work to address them and make their lives better. That's what truly and genuinely motivates him at his core and thats what I know he will bring to the Senate if we can elect him there.

I wanted to reach out to you on behalf of Adam Schiff in the final days of this primary election to explain why I believe he deserves our immediate support. With Donald Trump clearing the path toward the GOP presidential nomination, we need Adam in the Senate. If youre with me, please dont hesitate to rush a donation. Jenga, give me a moment to explain why I know Adam is the person we need in the United States Senate at this moment: On July 25, 2019, as a United States Army lieutenant colonel detailed to the National Security Council, I witnessed a telephone call between then-President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump called it a perfect call but it was far from it. During that call, President Trump pressured President Zelensky to investigate then-former Vice President Joe Biden as a quid pro quo to continue receiving United States military aid in their yearslong fight defending their territory from Russian aggression. I saw this for what it was: a blatant abuse of power, and political blackmail to aid President Trump in the 2020 election. As the White Houses Russia and Ukraine expert, I was also disturbed by what Russian dictator Vladimir Putin might attempt if the United States were no longer Ukraines ally and defense partner. I alerted my superiors and eventually testified before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, on which Rep. Adam Schiff served as chair. Adam conducted a thorough and fair investigation. Interviewed witnesses. Subpoenaed the relevant information and testimony. And as the lead manager of Trumps Senate trial, he secured the first bipartisan Senate vote to convict a U.S. president in the history of our country. We both did our duty to this country by protecting our democracy. We defended the values of truth, justice, and decency. And weve been punished by the Republican Party ever since. Trump has come after me and Adam Schiff. Hes lobbed attacks at Adam for his dutiful oversight and his fidelity to the Constitution. Republicans attack Adam on cable news and at MAGA campaign rallies. They removed him from his post as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. And they censured him last summer along party lines, under threat by Donald Trump. Through it all, Adam Schiff has held his head up high. Hes refused to relent in his efforts to hold Donald Trump and his MAGA allies to account. Thats why Im supporting Adam Schiff to represent California in the U.S. Senate. No matter how hard Trump and his cronies may try, we cannot afford to lose Adams voice in Congress. His leadership in defending our democracy has been one of the most consequential fights in recent memory. After the overwhelming majority of Senate Republicans voted to acquit Donald Trump in both of his impeachment trials, we need Adam in the Senate to fight for us. He needs our help to keep up that fight. So please, if youre able, Im respectfully asking you to contribute in support of Adam Schiffs Senate campaign.

Everywhere I go, I ask the same question: How can I help? Help can come in the form of legislation. Help can come from visiting communities at their time of greatest need, and making sure they arent forgotten. Help can also come in the form of fighting for federal funding so that Californians receive the same returns on their taxpayer dollars as lower-contributing states. And though it is one of the most overlooked aspects of serving in Congress, help is also providing exceptional constituent services. Helping seniors receive lost payments from the Social Security Administration. Helping to process veterans claims with the VA. Helping students get their loans forgiven.

When I was a young lad there was a United States Senator from California, named Alan Cranston who served a couple decades. Sharing that last name made me a little popular in my elementary school, but it also spurred my interest in politics. Over the years, the ebb and flow of political ideology was normal, and within reason, regardless of the party affiliation. Unfortunately thats not the case today. And I imagine that we share a deep concern about the future of our country. Every so often a champion rises to the occasion, someone with the courage and intelligence to fight for what is right not for what is politically safe. And that person couldnt be needed more than now. There is a champion among us. A person who put himself up as a target to his political opponents in order to stay true to his unwavering belief in our constitution and the defense of our democracy. I personally dont like hearing people tell me who to vote for, so I wont do that to you either. I will simply say that I am exceedingly proud to cast my vote for Californias next United States Senator for Adam Schiff. I strongly feel that we need his fearless leadership in the Senate. His clarion voice challenges the dangerous shift of policy within the new Trumpian Republican Party. But Adam is eager to continue working with the few remaining reasonable Republicans with respect and determination to find the common ground that will greatly improve our country. To do that we first need to get him into that position. As weve all witnessed, Adam has been on the front lines, fighting for justice, accountability, and a better future for all of us. He's shown us time and time again that he's willing to break bad politics, and deliver for California and the country, as only a true champion can. I am thoroughly convinced that we need Adam Schiff as our next US Senator to fight for a better and brighter future. Thanks for your time, and I wish you all well.

But he didnt care. He called me up at work the next week and asked me out to dinner. Since then, weve played plenty of tennis matches (hes improved his form since then but I still beat him ). And Ive been by Adams side through some incredibly serious moments. Did you know Adam lost his first two campaigns and didnt win until we got married? That was surely a coincidence In fact, during one of his campaigns, while we were recently engaged, a voter called to give us advice not on the campaign, but on our getting married. He advised us to think hard about it, and said of his own marriage: Its no picnic. Well, every year as we celebrate our anniversary (this is number 29), we take stock of what a good year it has been, then look at each other and remember no picnic. Never fails to make us crack up. But in all seriousness, from his first campaigns to writing legislation to make a difference in Californians lives, to serving as lead impeachment manager, Adam has been diligent and fiercely committed to the values we share.

Im a lifelong Californian myself, and Ive had the great privilege of being represented by some incredible Senators throughout my life. From watching Adams work in the California legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives, Ive seen that Adam shares a quality with all of them: He knows he works for us, not the other way around. Its why Adam has fought so hard to pass legislation to help build affordable housing, why he fought so hard to expand access to healthcare, and why he fought so hard to hold Trump accountable during his impeachment trial. And its why he fights for us still. Despite all of the attacks from Trump, Kevin McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and everyone in between Adam has remained steadfast and strong. And I believe he will continue to do so as Californias next Senator. Imagine what California would be like if we had a Freaky Friday-like swap and had a MAGA Republican like Steve Garvey representing California in the Senate? Now thats Freaky. Steve Garvey refuses to condemn Donald Trump. He refuses to acknowledge the constitutional and national right to an abortion much less fight for it. And he has the ability to self-fund. Thats why Im grateful we have a leader like Adam who will always stand up to Republicans like Garvey, and some of Trumps biggest enablers many of whom are in the Senate. We deserve leaders like Adam in the Senate who wont back down from the big fights. For equality. For opportunity. For the common good. For democracy. And the truth is that many of the most important fights we face will be waged in the United States Senate. And California needs to elect a Senator who can take on those big fights and get things done. Thats why Im supporting Adam in this race, and I hope you will, too.

Donald Trump speaking on a podium This is Donald Trump. For four years, he worked to enrich himself, blackmail Americas allies, and overturn a democratic election as President of the United States. He worked closely with this guy to get it done. Mitch McConnell holding up his fist As Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell shamelessly worked to block President Obamas progress and steamroll Trumps agenda through the Senate. He pushed to confirm 3 conservative Supreme Court justices to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court and acquit Donald Trump in both of his impeachment trials. Both Trump and Mitch are working to take back control in Washington and they have their eyes on this guy to do it: Steve Garvey This is MAGA multimillionaire Steve Garvey. Garvey jumped in the open U.S. Senate race and would be a rubber stamp for the GOPs agenda if elected. He has millions to try and get it done. Heres the person who can stop all of this from happening: Adam Schiff smiling and speaking into a microphone This is Adam. Adam has fought tirelessly to deliver for the people of California. Hes worked to bring millions of dollars back to our state, stand up for access to affordable health care, and lower costs for everyday Californians. Hes not afraid to stand up to bullies. In fact, he served as the lead manager in Donald Trumps first impeachment trial and secured the first bipartisan vote in history against a sitting president.

We need to elect someone who wont back down from a tough fight and knows how to get things done. The twice-impeached, four-times-indicted ex-presidents recklessness and impulsiveness put this country in peril several times, and we must take him seriously as a threat to our democracy. Yet time and again, very few have held him accountable for his actions. Adam Schiff has. Again and again. Over the years, Ive watched Adam do the important work to investigate Trump, lead the impeachment trial, and hold his feet to the fire for the January 6th insurrection. Adam has shown that he doesnt back down from big fights. Hes defended our democracy and our shared values throughout his career, and hell keep up those fights in the Senate. But Trump and his cronies also know this, Jenga. Thats why they continue to attack Adam on television, on social media, and at their campaign rallies. Electing Adam to the U.S. Senate would be their worst nightmare so I need your help to make sure thats exactly where Adam ends up. So what do you say, Jenga?

Weve made a lot of progress the past two years, but the American people have made it clear that we should be doing even more. We took on big polluters to make the largest climate investment in our nations history. We took on the NRA to pass the first federal gun safety legislation in three decades. We took on Big Pharma to cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs by letting Medicare negotiate directly with the drug companies. We made a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure, green jobs and 21st-century manufacturing with the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the CHIPS and Science Act. But the filibuster is intact. Roe v. Wade has been overturned. And now that GOP legislatures have gerrymandered away the Democratic House majority, its clear that the fight for the future of our democracy will happen within the Senate. We must press on to continue the hard work of repairing the damage Trump and MAGA Republicans have done to our nation and its institutions while defending against their continued attempts to propagate the Big Lie and undermine the right to vote. We must do so in the context of another Trump presidential campaign already in full swing. There are so many important priorities right now, and I want to know where you think I should focus my efforts as we build this Senate campaign. Will you take a moment (just a moment) to tell me what you think I should prioritize on this campaign? After all, Jenga, you have taken up the struggle for the heart and soul of our democracy, and you should help set our agenda.

His confirmation stalled for years due to bipartisan opposition over his bizarre obsession with controlling peoples bodies, an issue he was even caught lying about during his nomination process: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Headline from The Dallas Morning News: John Cornyn says Judge Kacsmaryk should not have taken name off anti-abortion article. Excerpt: 'The process only works if we. have candor and truthful answers. So that's significant,' said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee responsible for vetting Kacsmaryk's nomination. The next year, while his nomination languished in the Senate, Kacsmaryk made an investment in his future by becoming a campaign donor to Josh Hawley, a fellow member of the Federalist Society a group of corporate activist lawyers with funders including Chevron, Google, and the Kochs. Once Hawley was sworn into the U.S. Senate in 2019, he decided to make Kacsmaryk, his campaign donor, a federal judge. Hawley confirmed Kacsmaryk to the northern Texas district court, despite even more bipartisan opposition over Kacsmaryks Big Brother views on contraceptives and personal freedoms. Flash forward to 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the northern Texas district court by activist lawyers seeking to ban an abortion pill that millions have used safely. Abortion medication accounts for over half of all abortions. Josh Hawleys wife led the suit. His donor was the judge.

Just days after Kacsmaryks ruling, Josh Hawley used his Senate office to submit an amicus brief demanding that the Supreme Court end a temporary injunction blocking the ruling (in his wife's lawsuit) by a judge (his campaign donor) to ban America's most commonly-used abortion medication.

While communities like mine all across our state were stripped for parts, corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley attacked workers with anti-union schemes like Right-to-Work and fought to block wage increases for Missouri families all to enrich multinational corporations and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns and their careers. They helped Wall Street financiers sell off our farmland to billionaires in China and Brazil devastating rural communities and contributing to the closure of 90% of Missouri hog producers in a single generation. One of Missouris oldest and largest employers, Anheuser-Busch, was sold to a Belgian conglomerate costing Missouri more than a thousand jobs. Missouri-based Monsanto, one of the worlds most important agrochemical and biotechnology companies, was sold to Germany eliminating even more jobs. And as dozens more headquarters have been taken out of state, politicians in power like Josh Hawley were happy to sit back and watch it happen. Manufacturing, agriculture, production theyre shipping it all away to foreign oligarchs who dont care about working people in our state. And while our communities were getting gutted, these same politicians voted time and time again to spend trillions of dollars and thousands of lives on overseas wars that got their Big Oil friends rich. These politicians have spent decades sparking phony culture wars to distract and divide our families. Theyve become so obsessed with controlling our lives, they made Missouri the first state in the nation to ban abortion without exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Our state deserves a Senator who will stand up and fight for it and Im ready to serve.

For the last three election cycles, Missouri voters have side-stepped our politicians by voting to increase the minimum wage well above the federal level, expand health care, repeal an anti-worker Right-to-Work scheme, legalize weed, and enact more protections against political corruption with wide margins.

Were going to build an economy that puts American workers and small businesses in charge, not giant corporations and foreign oligarchs an economy that invests in putting America first in the next generation of energy, semiconductors, and supply chain independence.

Multiple polls put Lucas and Hawley in a margin-of-error race for Missouris U.S. Senate seat. 3.Missourians have a history of taking back their power at the ballot box. Since his last election, voters have broken with Hawley to approve measures that raised the minimum wage, expanded healthcare, and legalized weed with huge margins of victory. And after major recent wins for red state Democrats in Kentucky and Ohio, Missouri is next. 4.Every $1 in Missouri can go nearly five times as far compared to states like Texas and Florida. Our state has small media markets, which means well be able to reach Missourians with Lucas message early and often on TV, online, and on the ground. 5.The stakes have never been higher.

Just three wholesalers control about 90% of drug distribution for pharmacies. A handful of giant overseas corporations control 80% of our drug supply chain. And now we have drug shortages for everything from cancer drugs to Adderall. Everyday people suffer, some even die, but Big Pharma will still get record profits that's what monopoly power looks like.

The facts are clear on this: We CAN make these essential drugs in America and get them to those who need them. But Big Pharma chooses not to. To their top executives and biggest elite shareholders, record-breaking profits matter more than the shortages that cost Americans their lives and livelihoods. And, of course, theres a reason our politicians havent already done something big about these drug shortages. Money. That's why my campaign doesnt take a cent from Big Pharma executives. And it's the reason Im fighting to ban stock ownership for members of Congress, judges, and regulators (including fake blind trusts).

Ill fight to make sure that when Big Pharma fails to deliver essential drugs to the Americans who need them, they won't just have to worry about bad press or long lines They'll risk losing that market to a new Made-In-America competitor with generic prices. With my plan, America will find, build, or modify the facilities necessary to make the essential drugs Big Pharma is failing to deliver (right now, 30% of American pharmaceutical manufacturing sites are already at or below 50% utilization). Then well find the businesses and workers to run them on contracts that put patriotism over extreme profits. Well have American-made drugs that Americans can actually afford.

Missouris former Senior Senator Roy Blunt secured more than $350 million for our state in his final year in the U.S. Senate. But this week, new reporting from the Kansas City Star found that Missouri lost out on hundreds of millions of dollars under the leadership of Missouris current Senior Senator, Josh Hawley. These funds typically cover critical investments like improvements at state universities, upgrades for local police departments, and aid for community groups. But instead of doing his job and fighting for that money to come home to Missouri, Josh Hawley has only thought about himself. After he violated Missouri open records laws, Missouri taxpayers were on the hook for more than $250,000 which Hawley refuses to pay back: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]Headline from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: MO taxpayers paid more than $250,000 for Josh Hawley's open records violations. On top of that, hes been busy making money on the side with book sales like his creepy Manhood book and raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars more than his Congressional salary. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Business Insider headline: This Republican senator nearly tripled his congressional salary courtesy of a quirk in federal law. Excerpt: GOP Senator Josh Hawley is the latest lawmaker to reveal a significant publishing income. He disclosed $467,000 in book royalties, far more than his $174,000 salary for being a senator. If Hawley has another six-year term in the U.S. Senate, Missouri could lose out on $2.1 BILLION or more in federal funds. Thats a major liability for Missourians. Lucas Kunce is running to replace Hawley because its time we had a U.S. Senator who will fight like hell for investment in Missouris communities not another self-obsessed politician who cant be bothered to actually fight for our state.

Hawley won his last race with only 51% of the vote. And now, reporting from Morning Consult shows that Hawley remains the least popular GOP U.S. Senator up for re-election in 2024 with approval numbers even worse than Ted Cruz in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida! 2.National Republicans are already targeting our race. These insiders know that if they dont step in to make Josh Hawley look strong, theres a real chance they could lose this Senate seat. So from launching desperate attacks about Lucas to funding a new GOP Super PAC with millions of dollars, theyre already hard at work to keep this seat under their thumb. 3.After major wins for red-state Democrats and abortion rights in Kentucky and Ohio, we have an opportunity to make Missouri next. Over the last three election cycles, Missouri voters have broken with politicians like Hawley to reject anti-union Right-to-Work, raise the minimum wage, expand Medicaid, and legalize weed. So in 2024, we really can defeat Josh Hawley and take this Senate seat back for everyday people. 4.Our movement can harness that grassroots energy. From outraising Hawleys campaign to earning support from dozens of statewide and local unions across Missouri, Lucas is proving that our election-winning message and sheer people-power will be a real force to be reckoned with. 5.Multiple recent polls show Lucas Kunce in a statistical tie with Josh Hawley. After working hard to hold Hawley accountable, Lucas has already made this a margin-of-error race. Now, weve got to keep this momentum going. Our first major FEC fundraising deadline of 2024 is just weeks away, so staying on track with our goals is the surest way well be able to keep reaching voters with Lucas message, flip this Senate seat, and take back power for everyday people this November. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]So Jenga, will you add $5 (or more!) toward our goal of raising 2,500 individual donations before midnight tomorrow?

While communities like mine all across our state were stripped for parts, corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley attacked workers with anti-union schemes like Right-to-Work and fought to block wage increases for Missouri families all to enrich multinational corporations and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns and their careers. They helped Wall Street financiers sell off our farmland to billionaires in China and Brazil devastating rural communities and contributing to the closure of 90% of Missouri hog producers in a single generation. One of Missouris oldest and largest employers, Anheuser-Busch, was sold to a Belgian conglomerate costing Missouri more than a thousand jobs. Missouri-based Monsanto, one of the worlds most important agrochemical and biotechnology companies, was sold to Germany eliminating even more jobs. And as dozens more headquarters have been taken out of state, politicians in power like Josh Hawley were happy to sit back and watch it happen. Manufacturing, agriculture, production theyre shipping it all away to foreign oligarchs who dont care about working people in our state.

Nearly two years ago, Josh Hawley turned his back on veterans like me by voting to stall the PACT Act, legislation that expanded healthcare coverage for those of us who were exposed to these toxic pits. Now Im running to replace him in the U.S. Senate. So before I ask you to [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]add a donation of any amount to my grassroots campaign, please let me share more about why this issue is personal to me and how it has impacted so many of my fellow veterans. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]Photo of the burn pit Lucas lived next to in Iraq. Large column of smoke streaming up into the sky. It was 2009. I was stationed at the Al Taqaddum Airbase where I was a Marine Captain leading a police training team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman. Running missions through Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. It was my first of three tours of duty during the War on Terror. And from our camp, the bases burn pit loomed over us. Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on our duty. For me, that was planning our routes and poring over intel to avoid the immediate danger: IEDs on all the convoys and missions we were running outside the wire. I was so proud to bring every member of that team home safely. Or so I thought because, as it turns out, we couldnt protect ourselves from our own country. When I got back from Iraq, I developed a persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic. They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, its still there. Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And thats about the best story youll hear about a vet whos been exposed to burn pits. Many struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer. So imagine how we all felt, watching all these Republicans like Josh Hawley, most of whom have never even worn the uniform, throw us a giant middle finger by blocking efforts to expand healthcare for veterans exposed to these toxic burn pits.

Patriots dont attack veterans who suffered injuries or illness from being around those toxic pits. Many of these same Republicans spent years voting to keep us in these forever wars, lying to the American people about what was really going on over there, and getting rich off their defense contractor stocks that skyrocket when were at war. These people profited off of sending us over there only to screw us when we came back messed up. Its criminal and Im ready to do something about it. I served my country for 13 years in the United States Marine Corps. Id give anything for this country. Thats exactly why Im running to replace Josh Hawley in the U.S. Senate.

Josh Hawley and his corrupt family business made that case happen, in the same way they led the charge to overturn Roe v. Wade, and Hawley abused his power as Missouris U.S. Senator to do it all. Please let me explain: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]Quote from Josh Hawley in an article on LifeSite: 'I would support any restriction on abortion.

His confirmation stalled for years due to bipartisan opposition over his bizarre obsession with controlling peoples bodies, an issue he was even caught lying about during his nomination process: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Headline from The Dallas Morning News: John Cornyn says Judge Kacsmaryk should not have taken name off anti-abortion article. Excerpt: 'The process only works if we. have candor and truthful answers. So that's significant,' said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee responsible for vetting Kacsmaryk's nomination. The next year, while his nomination languished in the Senate, Kacsmaryk made an investment in his future by becoming a campaign donor to Josh Hawley, a fellow member of the Federalist Society a group of corporate activist lawyers with funders including Chevron, Google, and the Kochs. Once Hawley was sworn into the U.S. Senate in 2019, he decided to make Kacsmaryk, his campaign donor, a federal judge. Hawley confirmed Kacsmaryk to the northern Texas district court, despite even more bipartisan opposition over Kacsmaryks Big Brother views on contraceptives and personal freedoms. Flash forward to 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the northern Texas district court by activist lawyers seeking to ban an abortion pill that millions have used safely. Abortion medication accounts for over half of all abortions. Josh Hawleys wife led the suit. His donor was the judge.

This was the first time a judge has ever unilaterally tried to take a drug off the market against FDA objections. Just days after Kacsmaryks ruling, Josh Hawley used his Senate office to submit an amicus brief demanding that the Supreme Court end a temporary injunction blocking the ruling (in his wife's lawsuit) by a judge (his campaign donor) to ban America's most commonly-used abortion medication. Now, that mifepristone case, which was decided by Hawleys donor judge and led by Hawleys wife, will be heard by the Supreme Court later this month.

Our leaders abandoned them and Josh Hawley is the perfect example. Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in out-of-touch culture wars and selling us his book all about manhood telling the whole world that the only way to be a man is to be exactly like him.

Nearly two years ago, Josh Hawley turned his back on veterans like me by voting to stall the PACT Act, legislation that expanded healthcare coverage for those of us who were exposed to these toxic pits. Now Im running to replace him in the U.S. Senate. So before I ask you to [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]add a donation of any amount to my grassroots campaign, please let me share more about why this issue is personal to me and how it has impacted so many of my fellow veterans. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]Photo of the burn pit Lucas lived next to in Iraq. Large column of smoke streaming up into the sky. It was 2009. I was stationed at the Al Taqaddum Airbase where I was a Marine Captain leading a police training team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman. Running missions through Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. It was my first of three tours of duty during the War on Terror. And from our camp, the bases burn pit loomed over us. Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on our duty. For me, that was planning our routes and poring over intel to avoid the immediate danger: IEDs on all the convoys and missions we were running outside the wire. I was so proud to bring every member of that team home safely. Or so I thought because, as it turns out, we couldnt protect ourselves from our own country. When I got back from Iraq, I developed a persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic. They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, its still there. Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And thats about the best story youll hear about a vet whos been exposed to burn pits. Many struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer. So imagine how we all felt, watching all these Republicans like Josh Hawley, most of whom have never even worn the uniform, throw us a giant middle finger by blocking efforts to expand healthcare for veterans exposed to these toxic burn pits.

On the right, a Fox News op-ed headline by Lucas Kunce reading: I was exposed to toxic burn pits in Iraq; Republicans turned their backs on veterans like me What they did was about as anti-American as it gets. Patriots dont attack veterans who suffered injuries or illness from being around those toxic pits. Many of these same Republicans spent years voting to keep us in these forever wars, lying to the American people about what was really going on over there, and getting rich off their defense contractor stocks that skyrocket when were at war. These people profited off of sending us over there only to screw us when we came back messed up. Its criminal and Im ready to do something about it. I served my country for 13 years in the United States Marine Corps. Id give anything for this country. Thats exactly why Im running to replace Josh Hawley in the U.S. Senate.

Ive watched their community go downhill for years. While corrupt politicians shipped jobs overseas and voted to give handouts to Wall Street and their corporate allies, everyday people just trying to survive in the place they call home ran out of money and opportunities. Our leaders abandoned them and Josh Hawley is the perfect example. Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in out-of-touch culture wars and selling us his book all about manhood telling the whole world that the only way to be a man is to be exactly like him. Well when I think about manhood, I think about courage. And thats not something you can give speeches or write a book about. Missouri is the Show Me State. Courage is something you have to show us. Thats why Im supporting Lucas Kunce for Missouris U.S. Senate seat. As a born-and-raised Missourian who joined the Marines to serve the community that took care of him growing up, Lucas has already shown us that he knows the true meaning of courage. Lucas knows courage is about standing up to the powerful and working to rebuild our state. And he knows real leaders fight to empower everyday people and secure our future for generations to come not for their own power or profit. So Jenga, if you want to be told about manhood, some guy wrote a book about it.

[ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]CHIP IN NOW Every three months, the Federal Election Commission requires every candidate running for federal office to submit the full report of their campaigns fundraising numbers into the public record everything from how much weve raised, how many donations weve received, and who weve received those donations from. These quarterly reports are an important measure of transparency. They give the public an opportunity to look under the hood of our grassroots movement and hold us accountable. But everyday people arent the only ones paying attention. DC insiders, members of the media, and even Josh Hawley himself will have access to all this information too and theyll use it to make all kinds of judgments about the strength of our campaign. So heres the reality: Lucas outraised Hawley over all of 2023, but our campaign cant take outraising him this quarter for granted ESPECIALLY since national Republicans and corporate mega-donors have already shown their willingness to spend whatever it takes to make Hawley look strong. Thats why we need all hands on deck this month, Jenga. We need this grassroots team to show up, and when we submit our report after March 31st, we need your name to be on it. Thats why were asking earlier than normal: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Will you help our campaign stay on track to have another record-breaking fundraising quarter by adding a donation of $25, $10, or whatever you think is best today?

Thats why Im fighting to abolish corporate PACs and ban insider trading for members of Congress and its why Im holding myself and my campaign to that same standard. Putting people in charge of their own lives: Politicians like Josh Hawley are obsessed with controlling every aspect of our lives. Im committed to restoring abortion access and protecting reproductive freedom in all 50 states by ending the filibuster and codifying Roe v. Wade finally giving people the power to make decisions about their own bodies, families, and economic opportunities. Showing up for working Missourians: Real workers are tired of corporate elites and frauds writing the rules we all have to live by. Ill always stand on the side of working people by continuing to fight for the right to organize and pushing back against anti-union Right-to-Work scams in Missouri + all across the country. A Marshall Plan for the Midwest: DC politicians spent decades wasting trillions of dollars on corporate handouts and forever wars.

THEN: A report from Morning Consult showed that Hawley has the lowest approval rating of any Republican U.S. Senator up for re-election this cycle even worse than Ted Cruz in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida. AND NOW: Multiple recent polls found Hawley in a statistical tie with Lucas! We have a real opportunity to defeat Josh Hawley and flip Missouris U.S. Senate seat this year, but its not going to be easy [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]and we need your help to get it done.

Lucas isnt taking any money from shady insiders or corporate mega-donors in this race hes relied on real people to power this movement forward since Day One. But if were going to win this race, we need to have the resources to both combat the GOPs desperate attacks AND reach voters with Lucas positive vision for Missouri.

Heres why: 1.Josh Hawley is seriously vulnerable. In 2018, he won his Senate seat with only 51% of the vote. After he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January 6, he became the least popular GOP U.S. Senator up for re-election this year with even lower approval ratings than Ted Cruz and Rick Scott. 2.Were building the grassroots movement that can defeat Josh Hawley. After outraising Hawley in 2023 and earning major endorsements from groups like the Missouri AFL-CIO, End Citizens United, and League of Conservation Voters, were proving that Lucas Kunce is a real force to be reckoned with in this election. Multiple polls have proved it too already finding this race between Lucas and Hawley in a statistical tie. 3.Every $1 here in Missouri can go nearly five times as far compared to states like Texas and Florida. Because of our states small media markets, well be able to reach Missourians with Lucas message early and often for a fraction of what it would cost in those other big states. Were building the record-breaking, people-powered movement that can defeat Josh Hawley and elect a real warrior for working people like Lucas Kunce to Missouris U.S. Senate seat. But the only way well be able to get our election-winning message in front of voters is with support from real people like you.

ENDORSE LUCAS This week, Josh Hawley signaled his support for Rick Scott as the new Senate GOP leader despite his efforts to destroy Social Security and Medicare. Its no big surprise, considering the fact that Hawley has never actually stood up for Missouris seniors and workers during his time in the U.S. Senate. Hes voted against bills to protect these critical benefits at nearly every opportunity. And hes thrown his support behind politicians like Blake Masters, who supported privatizing Social Security and told voters weve got to cut the knot at some point. Missouris seniors and workers deserve to have someone in the U.S. Senate who they can trust to fight for every penny theyre owed, not a pampered phony like Josh Hawley who doesnt know a thing about what its like to struggle. Thats why Social Security Works endorsed Lucas Kunce. They know Lucas will fight to protect the promise of Social Security for every worker who earned it and they know he wont let any corrupt politician get in his way.

Hawley won his last race with only 51% of the vote. And now, Morning Consult shows that hes the most unpopular GOP Senator up for re-election this year with approval ratings even lower than Ted Cruz in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida! 2.National Republicans have made this race their top defensive target. These insiders know that if they dont step in to tear down Lucas and make Josh Hawley look strong, theres a real chance they could lose this Senate seat. So from launching desperate attacks to a new mega-donor funded Super PAC, theyre already hard at work to keep this seat under their thumb. 3.After major wins for red state Democrats and abortion rights in Kentucky and Ohio, we have an opportunity to make Missouri next. Over the last three election cycles, Missouri voters have broken with politicians like Hawley to reject anti-union Right-to-Work, raise the minimum wage, expand Medicaid, and legalize weed. So in 2024, we really can defeat Josh Hawley. 4.Lucas Kunce has proved that he can harness that grassroots energy. First, he outraised Hawley quarter after quarter. Then, he earned the support of the Missouri AFL-CIO, local and statewide leaders, major national organizations like League of Conservation Voters, and tens of thousands of everyday working people who are ready to take back their power from corrupt politicians. 5.Multiple recent polls show Lucas Kunce in a statistical tie with Hawley. After working hard to hold Hawley accountable last year, Lucas has put this race in a dead heat. This is the clearest sign yet that we really can flip this seat. But now, weve got to keep this momentum going. Hitting our goal tonight means well have the ability to stand up to the onslaught of GOP attacks and keep getting Lucas election-winning message in front of Missouri voters.

My parents were already living paycheck-to-paycheck, and when my little sister was born with a heart condition, they were bankrupted by medical bills. But we were never alone. Friends, neighbors, people in our community who had no more than we did all came together to support my family. They helped me go to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything they did for us. Between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest things was coming home and seeing what was happening in my old neighborhood. It was a community picked for parts the local corner store boarded up, our familys first house in the neighborhood bulldozed to the ground. While all of us risked our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians and the corporate elites backing them let our country waste away. They spent 20 years and trillions of dollars on pointless forever wars and defense contractors, but could never seem to figure out how to invest even a fraction of that amount back into our own communities. After decades of corrupt politicians using their power to control us and massive corporations stripping our communities for parts, Im running for U.S. Senate because I want everyday Missourians people who know how to take care of each other to call the shots in our country. Together, we can stop handing out money for Wall Street and forever wars, and we can create a Marshall Plan for the Midwest to rebuild our forgotten towns and cities here at home. We can build an economy that puts workers and small businesses in charge one that puts America first in the next generation of energy, semiconductors, and supply chain independence. We can end the filibuster, codify Roe, and stop the Big Brother attacks on reproductive rights by control-obsessed politicians in Missouri and nationwide. And we can finally hold our politicians accountable by abolishing corporate PACs and banning insider trading for members of Congress.

Im the veteran and Democrat who was elected statewide as Missouris Secretary of State and then nearly defeated Roy Blunt, an incumbent GOP Senator, in one of the closest races of the 2016 election cycle. With Joe Manchins retirement taking West Virginias Senate race off the board, our Senate race here in Missouri is the perfect candidate to replace it.

But first, please let me explain why I know Lucas has what it takes to flip this Senate seat: If you've stored your info with ActBlue Express, we'll process your contribution instantly: [ Crossing&state=MA&amount=10&t=1003 ]Contribute $10 [ Crossing&state=MA&amount=25&t=1004 ]Contribute $25 [ Crossing&state=MA&amount=30&t=1005 ]Contribute $30 [ Crossing&state=MA&amount=50&t=1006 ]Contribute $50 [ Crossing&state=MA&amount=100&t=1007 ]Contribute $100 [ Crossing&state=MA&amount=250&t=1008 ]Contribute $250 [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1009 ]Give another amount If youve followed election coverage over the last year or so, the pundits might lead you to believe something new is happening. Despite high disapproval for President Joe Biden in red states like Kentucky and Mississippi, Democrats outperformed their partys presidential margin in statewide races by double digits. And after Republican-dominated legislatures passed extreme abortion bans in red states like Kansas and Ohio, voters delivered huge wins for reproductive rights and democracy. But the truth is, this isnt all that new. While pundits and insiders increasingly divide us into columns of red and blue based on their one-dimensional view of politics, voters continue to confound their expectations in election after election. Missouri is a great example. While our state has shifted solidly red in presidential preferences since 2012, Democrats have won a half-dozen statewide campaigns, even as recently as 2018. And when Missouri politicians have adopted extreme positions on issues such as abortion, workers rights or health care, theyve often seen their out-of-touch agendas soundly rejected by voters. Just like voters in states where weve seen big wins for Democrats and pro-freedom initiatives in the past year, hundreds of thousands of voters in Missouri are still splitting their tickets. I know this more than most because Ive lived it. I won a race for Missouri Secretary of State. And in 2016, Missouris last Senate race to take place during a presidential election, I fell just 2.8% short of defeating a longtime Republican incumbent for U.S. Senate. And I outperformed the Democratic presidential tickets margin by more than 16%. We proved that in races where well-funded candidates can set themselves apart and make it clear to voters that theyll fight for them in office, Democrats can win in Missouri. Thats what were seeing in Missouris current U.S. Senate race, as my friend Lucas Kunce takes on incumbent Josh Hawley. Much like my race in 2016, 2024 pits a labor-backed veteran against a politician except my opponent never tried to overthrow the government violently just to get his name out there. Now up for reelection in 2024, Hawley faces Lucas, a Marine veteran and antitrust advocate whos broken fundraising records, rallied Missouris election-winning labor movement behind him and built a reputation as a different kind of Democrat who speaks truth to power, regardless of party. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1010 ]Im proud to support Lucas Kunce in his race against Josh Hawley and I hope youll join me by adding a donation of $10 or whatever youre able to today.

Hawley famously popped popcorn in his dorm room to gleefully watch the invasion of Iraq and then claimed a decade later to have opposed the war. And since hes represented Missouri in the U.S. Senate, hes also become known as a desperately anti-union scab who is self-consciously obsessed with manhood. From blocking defense nominations to voting against health care for veterans exposed to burn pits, Hawley has put his personal politics ahead of national security and the needs of military families. And hes used his office to build a family business dedicated to restricting abortion access nationwide as his allies in Jefferson City enacted one of the nations most extreme abortion bans. Now with five years under Hawleys belt in the U.S. Senate, Missourians dont like what theyve seen. Approval polling from Morning Consult shows that Hawley has the lowest approval of any GOP senator running for reelection in 2024, lower than Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida. And even his mentor, Missouris former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, has called backing Hawley the worst mistake I ever made. Donald Trump recently commented on Hawleys race too So interesting that the Democrats are looking hard at the Senate races in both Missouri and Texas. Josh and Ted must be very careful, stranger things have happened! Hawley is vulnerable, and everyone knows it. The proof is in his rapidly changing election-season rhetoric, Republicans in Washington fretting about their draconian abortion bans across the country, and Hawleys billionaire allies launching a new pro-Hawley super PAC right after Lucas entered the race.

In 2018, he won his Senate seat with only 51% of the vote. After he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January 6, he became the least popular GOP U.S. Senator up for re-election this year with even lower approval ratings than Ted Cruz and Rick Scott. 2.Were building the grassroots movement that can defeat Josh Hawley. After outraising Hawley in 2023 and earning major endorsements from groups like the Missouri AFL-CIO, End Citizens United, and League of Conservation Voters, were proving that Lucas Kunce is a real force to be reckoned with in this election. Multiple polls have proved it too already finding this race between Lucas and Hawley in a statistical tie. 3.Every $1 here in Missouri can go nearly five times as far compared to states like Texas and Florida. Because of our states small media markets, well be able to reach Missourians with Lucas message early and often for a fraction of what it would cost in those other big states. Were building the record-breaking, people-powered movement that can defeat Josh Hawley and elect a real warrior for working people like Lucas Kunce to Missouris U.S. Senate seat.

Im the veteran and Democrat who was elected statewide as Missouris Secretary of State and then nearly defeated Roy Blunt, an incumbent GOP Senator, in one of the closest races of the 2016 election cycle.

Despite high disapproval for President Joe Biden in red states like Kentucky and Mississippi, Democrats outperformed their partys presidential margin in statewide races by double digits. And after Republican-dominated legislatures passed extreme abortion bans in red states like Kansas and Ohio, voters delivered huge wins for reproductive rights and democracy. But the truth is, this isnt all that new. While pundits and insiders increasingly divide us into columns of red and blue based on their one-dimensional view of politics, voters continue to confound their expectations in election after election. Missouri is a great example. While our state has shifted solidly red in presidential preferences since 2012, Democrats have won a half-dozen statewide campaigns, even as recently as 2018. And when Missouri politicians have adopted extreme positions on issues such as abortion, workers rights or health care, theyve often seen their out-of-touch agendas soundly rejected by voters. Just like voters in states where weve seen big wins for Democrats and pro-freedom initiatives in the past year, hundreds of thousands of voters in Missouri are still splitting their tickets. I know this more than most because Ive lived it. I won a race for Missouri Secretary of State. And in 2016, Missouris last Senate race to take place during a presidential election, I fell just 2.8% short of defeating a longtime Republican incumbent for U.S. Senate. And I outperformed the Democratic presidential tickets margin by more than 16%. We proved that in races where well-funded candidates can set themselves apart and make it clear to voters that theyll fight for them in office, Democrats can win in Missouri. Thats what were seeing in Missouris current U.S. Senate race, as my friend Lucas Kunce takes on incumbent Josh Hawley. Much like my race in 2016, 2024 pits a labor-backed veteran against a politician except my opponent never tried to overthrow the government violently just to get his name out there. Now up for reelection in 2024, Hawley faces Lucas, a Marine veteran and antitrust advocate whos broken fundraising records, rallied Missouris election-winning labor movement behind him and built a reputation as a different kind of Democrat who speaks truth to power, regardless of party. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1010 ]Im proud to support Lucas Kunce in his race against Josh Hawley and I hope youll join me by adding a donation of $10 or whatever youre able to today.

Hawley famously popped popcorn in his dorm room to gleefully watch the invasion of Iraq and then claimed a decade later to have opposed the war. And since hes represented Missouri in the U.S. Senate, hes also become known as a desperately anti-union scab who is self-consciously obsessed with manhood. From blocking defense nominations to voting against health care for veterans exposed to burn pits, Hawley has put his personal politics ahead of national security and the needs of military families. And hes used his office to build a family business dedicated to restricting abortion access nationwide as his allies in Jefferson City enacted one of the nations most extreme abortion bans. Now with five years under Hawleys belt in the U.S. Senate, Missourians dont like what theyve seen. Approval polling from Morning Consult shows that Hawley has the lowest approval of any GOP senator running for reelection in 2024, lower than Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida. And even his mentor, Missouris former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, has called backing Hawley the worst mistake I ever made. Donald Trump recently commented on Hawleys race too So interesting that the Democrats are looking hard at the Senate races in both Missouri and Texas. Josh and Ted must be very careful, stranger things have happened! Hawley is vulnerable, and everyone knows it. The proof is in his rapidly changing election-season rhetoric, Republicans in Washington fretting about their draconian abortion bans across the country, and Hawleys billionaire allies launching a new pro-Hawley super PAC right after Lucas entered the race.

Please let us explain. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]JEZEBEL: Let's Look at Senator Josh Hawley's Connections to the Abortion Pill Case. Excerpt: Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk donated to Hawley's campaign in 2018. Hawley is sworn in as senator in early 2019 and votes to confirm Kacsmaryk in June 2019 (the vote was 52 to 46). A few months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, activists represented by ADF file the abortion pill suit in Kacsmaryk's single-judge district. Hawley's wife is part of the ADF team to argue the case before Kacsmaryk in March 2023. Kacsmaryk then rules in favor of Hawley's wife. And, finally, Hawley signs on to a Supreme Court amicus brief supporting his wife's case. IN 2017: Matt Kacsmaryk was nominated to be a federal judge for the north Texas district court. His confirmation stalled for years. We learned he even lied to hide just how bizarre his obsession with controlling peoples bodies really is: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]Headline from The Dallas Morning News: John Cornyn says Judge Kacsmaryk should not have taken name off anti-abortion article. Excerpt: 'The process only works if we. have candor and truthful answers. So that's significant,' said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee responsible for vetting Kacsmaryk's nomination. IN 2018: While his nomination languished in the Senate, Kacsmaryk made an investment in his future. So he became a campaign donor to Josh Hawley, a fellow member of the Federalist Society a group of corporate activist lawyers with funders including Chevron, Google, and the Kochs. IN 2019: Now a U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley decided to make Kacsmaryk, his campaign donor, a federal judge. Hawley confirmed Kacsmaryk to the northern Texas district court despite bipartisan opposition over Kacsmaryks Big Brother views on contraceptives and personal freedoms. IN 2022: A lawsuit was filed in the northern Texas district court by activist lawyers seeking to ban an abortion pill that millions have used safely. Abortion medication accounts for over half of all abortions. Josh Hawleys wife led the suit. His donor was the judge. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Photos of Josh Hawley and Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk on the left. On the right, a Vanity Fair headline that reads: Erin Morrow Hawley is leading the charge to ban abortion medication. She's also Josh Hawley's wife. APRIL 2023: Hawleys donor judge ruled in favor of the suit led by Hawleys wife, calling for a near-immediate ban on the abortion pill mifepristone in all 50 states. This was the first time a judge has ever unilaterally tried to take a drug off the market against FDA objections. Then, in his official capacity as U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley submitted an amicus brief demanding that the Supreme Court end a temporary injunction blocking the ruling (in his wife's lawsuit) by a judge (his campaign donor) to ban America's most commonly-used abortion medication. AND NOW: Weve learned that the mifepristone case (led by Hawleys wife) is being reviewed by the Supreme Court. But this is hardly the first time that the Hawley family business has made it all the way to the Supreme Court: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1004 ]Tweet from Josh Hawley on June 24, 2022: For those who wondered why I said, two years ago, I would vote to confirm ONLY Supreme Court Justices who acknowledged Roe was wrong, this is why. Amy Barrett was the first openly pro-life nominee of my lifetime. And she was the deciding vote. Josh Hawley has led the charge to ban abortion in our country and this year, were going to make Hawley own it.

In 2018, he won his Senate seat with only 51% of the vote. After he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January 6, he became the least popular GOP U.S. Senator up for re-election this year with even lower approval ratings than Ted Cruz and Rick Scott. 2.Missourians are ready to take back their power from politicians like Hawley. Since his last election, voters have broken with Hawley to approve measures that raised the minimum wage, expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, and legalized weed with huge margins of victory. 3.Every $1 here in Missouri can go nearly five times as far compared to states like Texas and Florida. Because of our states small media markets, well be able to reach Missourians with Lucas message early and often for a fraction of what it would cost in those other big states.

While his banker daddy was sending him to a fancy prep school miles from his hometown, my family and I were relying on our neighbors to survive bankruptcy and medical bills in mid-Missouri in a community where people took care of each other. Thats us on the left. When Hawley graduated from law school, he joined one of the worlds most elite corporate law firms. I joined the Marine Corps to pay back the community in Missouri that took care of me and my family. And when he was climbing the ladder to become another corrupt politician, I was serving my country and then working to prevent the pointless overseas wars that make us less safe.

[ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]CHIP IN NOW It was 2009. I was stationed at the Al Taqaddum Airbase where I was a Marine Captain leading a police training team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman. Running missions through Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. It was my first of three tours of duty during the War on Terror. And from our camp, the bases burn pit loomed over us. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Photo of the burn pit Lucas lived next to in Iraq. Large column of smoke streaming up into the sky. Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on our duty. For me, that was planning our routes and poring over intel to avoid the immediate danger: IEDs on all the convoys and missions we were running outside the wire. I was so proud to bring every member of that team home safely. Or so I thought because, as it turns out, we couldnt protect ourselves from our own country. When I got back from Iraq, I developed a persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic. They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, its still there. Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And thats about the best story youll hear about a vet whos been exposed to burn pits. Many struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer. So imagine how we all felt, watching all these Republicans like Josh Hawley, most of whom have never even worn the uniform, throw us a giant middle finger.

These people profited off of sending us over there only to screw us when we came back messed up. Its criminal and Im ready to do something about it.

I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, times had never been tougher. But we werent alone our community took care of us. When my parents had to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat.

Later the Pentagon. I was on the Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia. When I came home between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest things was seeing what was happening back in my old neighborhood. It was a community picked for parts the local corner store boarded up, my first family house bulldozed to the ground.

While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies for the industries that stripped our communities for parts like Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil and then told us they cant figure out how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and investing in our own people. I saw what was happening and I was ready to fight back. So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an organization that fights corporate monopolies we took on defense contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind. And now, Im running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and fundamentally change who has power in our country so everyday people call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a Marshall Plan for the Midwest a massive investment and job creation program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil fuels once and for all.

[ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]CHIP IN TO SUPPORT LUCAS KUNCE Most of my family is from a town called Ste. Genevieve. Ive watched their community go downhill for years. While corrupt politicians shipped jobs overseas and voted to give handouts to Wall Street and their corporate allies, everyday people just trying to survive in the place they call home ran out of money and opportunities. Our leaders abandoned them and Josh Hawley is the perfect example. Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in out-of-touch culture wars and selling us his book all about manhood telling the whole world that the only way to be a man is to be exactly like him. Well when I think about manhood, I think about courage. And thats not something you can give speeches or write a book about. Missouri is the Show Me State. Courage is something you have to show us. Thats why Im supporting Lucas Kunce for Missouris U.S. Senate seat. As a born-and-raised Missourian who joined the Marines to serve the community that took care of him growing up, Lucas has already shown us that he knows the true meaning of courage.

I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, times had never been tougher. But we werent alone our community took care of us. When my parents had to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat.

Their support helped send me to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything they had done for me and my family growing up. Got deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Later the Pentagon. I was on the Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia. When I came home between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest things was seeing what was happening back in my old neighborhood. It was a community picked for parts the local corner store boarded up, my first family house bulldozed to the ground.

While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies for the industries that stripped our communities for parts like Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil and then told us they cant figure out how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and investing in our own people. I saw what was happening and I was ready to fight back. So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an organization that fights corporate monopolies we took on defense contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind. And now, Im running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and fundamentally change who has power in our country so everyday people call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a Marshall Plan for the Midwest a massive investment and job creation program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil fuels once and for all. I want to codify Roe v. Wade, secure voting rights, and ban anti-union Right-to-Work scams forever. I want to put working people in charge of our country. But I need your help to get it done.

Every candidate running for federal office was required to submit the full report of their campaigns fourth-quarter fundraising numbers to the Federal Election Commission. And once Josh Hawley filed his report, we learned that Lucas didnt just outraise him last quarter our grassroots campaign outraised Hawley for all of 2023! [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]BREAKING NEWS: Kunce outraises Hawley for Q4 and all of 2023, breaking records. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]KEEP UP OUR MOMENTUM Last year, Lucas raised $5.4 million to defeat Josh Hawley with an average donation of $33 and grassroots donors from every single county across the state, setting the record for the most ever raised in an off-year by a Senate challenger in Missouri. This is a historic accomplishment for a grassroots campaign in our state, and it wouldnt have been possible without support from real people like you. But unfortunately, its not all good news today, Jenga: Yesterdays reports also revealed that national insiders are still determined to bail out Josh Hawley. They transferred nearly $500,000 directly into his campaign and raised more into the Super PAC they funded with $1M+ last summer. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]FIGHT BACK NOW At this point, its not surprising. The insiders and elites backing Hawley have known Lucas was a threat since the day he got into this race. Theyve acted on it too, with desperate attacks and big investments into Hawleys campaign quarter after quarter. But things got worse for Hawley at the end of last year. Morning Consult confirmed that hes the least popular Republican Senator up for re-election in 2024. Then, multiple polls showed Lucas already in a margin-of-error race with Hawley making this our best opportunity to flip a GOP-held U.S. Senate seat in this election cycle. With all that new information and likely lots more to come, we know those insiders are bound to ramp up their spending and attacks against Lucas from here. Theyll do anything it takes to make Hawley look strong in this race and theyre hoping their early investments will give him the edge he needs to win. Thats why were urgently asking for your help today, Jenga. Our grassroots campaign to elect Lucas Kunce is entirely powered by real people like you not shady mega-donors or corporate elites. So when you donate to our campaign, youre giving us the ability to fight back against the GOPs desperate attacks, reach voters in every corner of the state with Lucas unifying message, and win this race in November.

The support from our neighbors and friends motivated me to work hard, stay focused on school, and run on the cross-country team. After graduating from Jefferson City High School, I was able to get into Yale which I could afford in part due to a Pell grant and scholarships from people around town. I got to keep running at Yale, too. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1006 ]On the left: Lucas at his high school graduation. On the right: Lucas running during his time at Yale. After undergrad and then law school at Mizzou, I joined the Marine Corps to honor and serve the community that had done so much for me. Less than a year after I completed training, I deployed to Iraq on my first of three tours of duty in the War on Terror, before later being stationed at the Pentagon. During those 13 years of active duty I learned firsthand what service and sacrifice for your country really means: Doing the right thing when youre thousands of miles from home, believing in a mission thats bigger than yourself, and never forgetting the community you signed up to serve. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1007 ]Photos of Lucas during his service in the Marines In Iraq, I deployed to the Sunni Triangle where I led a police training team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman, running missions through Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. From our camp, the bases burn pit loomed over us. Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on our duty. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1008 ]Photos of the burn pit Lucas lived next to in Iraq. When I got back from living next to that burn pit, I had developed a persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic. They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, its still there. Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And thats about the best story youll hear about a vet whos been exposed to burn pits. Many struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer. So imagine how we all felt when politicians who had never worn the uniform, like Josh Hawley, threw us a giant middle finger and voted against aid for exposed veterans. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1009 ]Screengrab from an op-ed Lucas put in Fox News. My final tour was on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. There, I worked with the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, and other agencies to stop the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technology around the globe, to keep these weapons out of the hands of bad actors. I spent every day doing what I could to make the world a safer place, with fewer arms, less chance of conflict, and more money to spend on improving lives rather than destroying them. One of the hardest things for me between these tours was coming back home to Jeff City, to the community I had signed up to serve, and seeing what was going on in my old neighborhood. When I came back from Iraq, the first house Id ever lived in was bulldozed down. Now, its an empty lot: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1010 ]The empty lot where Lucas' childhood home once stood. When I came back from Afghanistan, the house I lived in when I joined the Marine Corps was vacant and starting to fall apart. The corner store was boarded up. The whole time all of us were risking our lives overseas, our leaders were spending trillions of dollars trying to build up towns in these other countries places like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat when we should have been spending our money, blood, and sweat on towns like St. Joe, St. Louis, and Jefferson City. From the Middle East to the Pentagon, my time in the Marine Corps provided me with direct insight into the control that giant corporations have over our tax dollars, our politics, and our everyday lives. So after active duty, I joined the American Economic Liberties Project the nations leading non-profit in the fight against monopoly power in our economy and our democracy. We took on the corrupt politicians and monopolists who dominate our lives, squeeze small businesses out of our markets, and enrich corporate elites at the expense of everyday Americans from Big Tech and agribusiness conglomerates, to pharmaceutical cartels and defense contractors. But now corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley dont just attack our way of life, but the democracy I swore to defend. Everyday people should be calling the shots in our country not giant corporations or the cowards and phonies they bought off in Washington. Thats why Im running for U.S. Senate: To take power back for working families in Missouri and across America. And make no mistake about it, Missouri is on the frontline of this fight. While our state has been getting stripped for parts, politicians like Josh Hawley have been attacking workers with schemes like Right-to-Work and fighting to block wage increases for Missouri families all to enrich multinational corporations and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns. As dozens of headquarters have been taken out of state, politicians in power like Josh Hawley were happy to sit back and watch it happen. Manufacturing, agriculture, production theyre shipping it all away to foreign oligarchs who dont care about working people in our state. And while Missouri was getting gutted, these same politicians voted time and time again to spend trillions of dollars and thousands of lives on overseas wars that got their Big Oil friends rich. Theyve spent decades sparking phony culture wars to distract and divide our families. Theyve become so obsessed with controlling our lives, they made Missouri the first state in the nation to ban abortion without exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Our state deserves a Senator who will stand up and fight for it, not run for the exit like Josh Hawley. Im running for U.S. Senate to be the warrior for working people that Missouri deserves to fight like hell for our state and our people. Weve spent months uniting Missouris election-winning labor movement behind our campaign with early endorsements from the Missouri AFL-CIO, Missouri Fire Fighters, and dozens more statewide and union locals. And multiple recent polls have shown were already in a tight race against Hawley, who Morning Consult has consistently found to be the most vulnerable GOP Senator running in 2024. But if were going to stand up to the DC insiders and corporate elites spending millions to prop up Hawley and keep their grip on this Senate seat, we need your support to continue building a record-breaking, people-powered movement. Im not taking a single cent from corporate PACs in this race so we can stand up to the status quo and take back power for real working people across the state. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1011 ]So Jenga, will you join our people-powered movement by chipping in $10 or whatever you can afford today?

And we can abolish corporate PACs and demand a government that safeguards our democracy and holds corrupt politicians accountable. We can build an economy that puts American workers and small businesses first, not giant corporations and foreign oligarchs an economy that invests in the next generation of energy. We can put an end to pointless, trillion-dollar wars and invest in a Marshall Plan for the Midwest a historic investment in our workers and communities to rebuild our forgotten towns and cities, and to finally start making stuff in America again.

Dave&rsquo;s first bus tour of the campaign is rolling. This month, Dave stopped in Berks, Snyder, and Union counties as part of his months-long tour of all 67 counties in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Dave literally and figuratively wants to keep the momentum going! We know some of you will not be able to see him on his tour, so we wanted to give you a chance to endorse Dave as he travels around Pennsylvania spreading his message about bringing REAL leadership to Washington. Will you sign your name to show Dave that loyal supporters like you are supporting him in this race? SIGN YOUR NAME TO ENDORSE DAVE We are going to show Dave this list before his next event, so we would really appreciate it if you could sign to endorse Dave. Thank you for being a dedicated member of Team McCormick! Together, we can take back Pennsylvania, the Senate Majority, and our country. Thank you, Team McCormick More About Dave McCormick My name is Dave McCormick and I&rsquo;m running for the U.S. Senate. I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that. Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, as it stands today, those dreams are at risk. We are at a breaking point and the direction we choose to go will chart the course for the future of Pennsylvania and our country. Time and again, America has proved resilient in the face of adversity. I have a plan and the experience to move our commonwealth forward. I am a battle-tested leader who is ready to fight for YOU.

Dave McCormick Army Veteran, USMA &lsquo;87 More About Dave McCormick My name is Dave McCormick and I&rsquo;m running for the U.S. Senate. I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that. Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, as it stands today, those dreams are at risk. We are at a breaking point and the direction we choose to go will chart the course for the future of Pennsylvania and our country. Time and again, America has proved resilient in the face of adversity. I have a plan and the experience to move our commonwealth forward. I am a battle-tested leader who is ready to fight for YOU. With Democrats holding the Senate Majority by just one seat, the significance of this Senate race will shape our future, for better or for worse.

We launched our &ldquo;Fighting for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Future&rdquo; bus tour in Lititz, PA a couple of weeks ago. The crowd was pumped up showing their support for Dave&rsquo;s campaign to shake up DC. Our campaign momentum is building daily. Recently, NBC News called Pennsylvania &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s most important swing state.&rdquo; We know all eyes are going to be on us this year, and we&rsquo;re leaving nothing to chance. Our momentum would be nothing without grassroots support from you, Jenga. As we travel through all of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 67 counties, I&rsquo;m hoping we can count on you to continue fueling the campaign &mdash; both literally and figuratively! Since launching, the &ldquo;Fighting for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Future&rdquo; bus has rolled into Lititz, Berks, Snyder, and Union counties, to name a few. A gallon of gas costs $3.37 in Reading, PA in Berks county. Can you chip in the cost of a gallon or two today? We&rsquo;d really appreciate it!

We sure are as you&rsquo;ll see in this Team McCormick Weekly Rundown. Here&rsquo;s what Dave has been up to&hellip; McCormick Op-Ed: Helping Parents Experience the Miracle of Life Dave McCormick Real Clear Pennsylvania Winning my first wrestling match, graduating from West Point, my first day working in the White House: none of these special moments will ever come close to the joy of becoming a father. Any parent can tell you that it&rsquo;s a feeling unlike any other. My wife Dina and I are blessed to share six amazing daughters between us, and watching them grow into remarkable young women is truly an unparalleled joy. Sadly, many families around the country aren&rsquo;t able to experience that miracle. Today, roughly 11% of women and 9% of men in the U.S. struggle with fertility. It&rsquo;s no wonder, then, that according to Pew, &ldquo;42% of Americans say they have used fertility treatments or personally know someone who has&rdquo; &mdash; a 9-point jump in the last five years. Parents struggling to conceive have found a ray of hope in options like in-vitro fertilization (IVF). This remarkable technology has helped bring 8 million babies into the world, and today roughly 2% of births in the United States come through IVF. As a firm believer in pro-family policies, I will always support access to IVF to enable parents across our country to welcome children. I believe that&rsquo;s something my fellow Republicans should be able to get on board with, so I was pleased to see the swift condemnation of Alabama&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos can be considered children and the state legislature&rsquo;s resulting quick action to codify IVF. My wife and I have many dear friends and colleagues who have used IVF, and we&rsquo;ve seen how powerful this technology can be in turning despair into the celebration of a new life. It is a true blessing for these families and our society. Take the story of Zac and Brittney Wolfe, a Pennsylvania couple eager to start a family but mired in the challenges of infertility for years. As they shared on Good Morning America, without IVF, their miracle of three amazing children would have never been possible. When I led Bridgewater Associates, our team felt strongly that we had an obligation to support those trying to have children as well as parents in the workplace. That&rsquo;s why as a company we helped pay for fertility services like IVF, which are often not covered by insurance and can be prohibitively expensive. We also offered financial assistance for adoption and surrogacy, as well as a paid family-leave policy. As CEO, I took great satisfaction from the fact that a number of friends and colleagues were able to experience the joy of having children thanks to these policies. They were good for our employees, good for their families, and good for business. These experiences as a leader have stayed with me and shaped my strong support for IVF. As a senator, I&rsquo;d work to protect this important option for the millions of Americans who are relying on it to start their own beautiful families. Our pro-family policies should expand beyond protecting IVF. The federal government can better support young mothers by improving access to maternal health care. We can also do more to support young families economically. From incentivizing paid family leave in the private sector to lowering the sky-high price of childcare, we can do more to help adults who feel like the blessing of children is &ldquo;out of reach.&rdquo; And we need to make contraceptives more accessible and more affordable for women. We should also promote adoption services &mdash; an important part of the conversation that has helped so many Americans expand their families and give young children a beautiful home. All of these policies make up the kind of pro-family agenda that I believe Washington so desperately needs. The miracle of life is a precious thing, and it&rsquo;s always worth standing up for. I&rsquo;ll continue to oppose any effort to restrict IVF because this is a moment where we need compassion and common sense to prevail, and I hope to bring that pro-family spirit to the United States Senate on behalf of all Pennsylvanians. - From @DaveMcCormickPA : Had a great day walking with the PA Ancient Order of Hibernians at the Philadelphia St. Patrick\\'s Day Parade &mdash; the second oldest St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in the country!

State of the Race: Six key Senate seats Republicans look to flip in 2024 Kyle Morris Fox News Republicans are gearing up for what could be an epic showdown for majority control of the Senate with several contentious elections around the country later this year&hellip;The Keystone State, a perennial general election battleground, will likely live up to its reputation once again in 2024 as it holds what will arguably be one of the most competitive and expensive Senate races in the country. Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat who served a decade as the state\\'s auditor general and then treasurer before first winning election to the Senate in 2006, is seeking a fourth six-year term in office. Casey, who is not expected to face any serious Democratic primary challenge, is the son of a popular former governor. Republicans appear united behind Dave McCormick, who is making his second straight Senate run. McCormick narrowly lost the state\\'s 2022 GOP Senate primary election to Dr. Mehmet Oz, who went on to lose in the general election to former Braddock Mayor John Fetterman. McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, West Point graduate, Gulf War combat veteran and Treasury Department official in former President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration, was endorsed by the Pennsylvania GOP in late September, soon after he entered the race. McCormick raised $5.4 million in his first quarter as a candidate. Casey\\'s campaign announced at the beginning of the year that it had raised more than $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. McCormick had been courted by national and state Republicans to run, and his candidacy gives the GOP a high-profile candidate with the ability to finance his own race. Fetterman: &lsquo;Hamas cowards&rsquo; hide behind Ramadan Jewish News Syndicate Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on a Jewish holiday on Oct. 7&mdash;50 years and a day after a group of Arab nations launched a surprise attack on the Jewish state during the High Holiday of Yom Kippur. Many world leaders, including in Washington, are saying that Israel should halt attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) is not one of them&hellip;David McCormick, a Republican candidate for the other Pennsylvania senate seat, agreed with Fetterman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; McCormick wrote. He added of his opponent, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s past time for Bob Casey to agree.&rdquo; Democrats attack GOP as &lsquo;carpetbaggers.&rsquo; But they love their million-dollar DC mansions Gabe Kaminsky Washington Examiner The campaign arm for Senate Democrats is &ldquo;itching&rdquo; to paint Republicans owning million-dollar homes outside states they&rsquo;re running in as out-of-touch &ldquo;carpetbaggers,&rdquo; Axios reported. There&rsquo;s just one problem: By that definition, so are wealthy Democratic lawmakers, according to property records reviewed by the Washington Examiner&hellip;Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Tommy Garcia told Axios on Sunday that the GOP&rsquo;s &ldquo;roster of recruits is full of carpetbaggers who don&rsquo;t know the first thing about the states they&rsquo;re running in and candidates who bring enough financial scandals and baggage to fill a bank vault.&rdquo; Republicans mentioned in the report as owning the out-of-state homes included ex-congressman Mike Rogers, who is running for Senate in Michigan, Pennsylvania Senate hopeful David McCormick, and Senate candidate Eric Hovde in Wisconsin &mdash; among others&hellip; - From @DaveMcCormickPA : It was an honor to be inducted into the PIAA District 4 Wrestling Hall of Fame at Williamsport Area High School last month! I&rsquo;m grateful for the lessons learned on and off the mat and will always be a proud member of PA&rsquo;s wrestling community. - From @DaveMcCormickPA : Thank you to our PA law enforcement officials who prevented enough fentanyl to kill over 531,000 Pennsylvanians from entering our communities. This dangerous drug is killing 4,000+ Pennsylvanians each year &mdash; every criminal who plays a role in distributing it must be stopped at the border or here at home!

Bob Casey Jr. and Republican Dave McCormick. The Pennsylvania Department of State announced last week that Republican Joseph Vodvarka withdrew from the primary while fellow GOPer Brandi Tomasetti was removed from the ballot. Democrat William Parker was also removed from the ballot. &ldquo;I am so proud to have support from Pennsylvanians across all 67 counties,&rdquo; McCormick told DVJournal. &ldquo;Together, we will retire Bob Casey and Joe Biden&rsquo;s failed policies of an open border, soaring crime, high inflation, and an assault on our energy sector and renew our commonwealth and country.&rdquo; Tomasetti and Vodvarka&rsquo;s ballot petition signature issues date back to mid-February when they failed to meet the ballot qualifications&hellip; Court rulings knock out Casey, McCormick opponents for U.S. Senate nominations Borys Krawczenuik WVIA Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick won&rsquo;t have opponents in the upcoming primary election after all. Casey&rsquo;s lone opponent, Will Parker of Allegheny County, conceded last week he didn&rsquo;t have enough valid signatures on his nominating petitions. So a Commonwealth Court judge ordered him removed from the April 23 primary ballot. Now, both of McCormick&rsquo;s potential opponents are off the ballot, too. Voters in both parties challenged the opponents&rsquo; nominating petitions&hellip; The dynamics of the brewing tug-of-war with David McCormick over Bob Casey\\'s Senate seat Bethany Rodgers Go Erie Pennsylvania, a purple state that often acts as an election bellwether, once again stands on the front lines of a presidential contest. And it\\'s also likely to be the battleground for a nationally significant Senate race, with longtime Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey seeking to defend his seat from a Republican challenger. Casey has coasted to victory in previous re-election contests, which he&rsquo;s won by nine percentage points or more, but he predicted during his January campaign kickoff that he faces a \"long, tough race\" this time around, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Political experts agree that the incumbent will likely face his strongest competition yet in David McCormick, the former hedge fund CEO poised to capture the GOP nomination and receive an outpouring of support from Republicans fighting for a Senate majority. McCormick, who narrowly lost a 2022 Senate primary to celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, enters the contest with experience campaigning across the commonwealth, deep pockets and powerful allies &mdash; and he has already clinched the backing of the Keystone State&rsquo;s party establishment&hellip; Senate candidate hears concerns from veterans Jerri Brouse Standard-Journal U.S. Senate Republican Candidate Dave McCormick sat down with a handful of area veterans Saturday at the Lewisburg Hotel Saturday, ready to to hear from voters on their concerns about the direction of the country and what specific challenges they are facing in the community. McCormick shared why he is running to represent the people of Pennsylvania in Washington, D.C., and discussed his unique perspective as someone who served in the U.S. military. McCormick was born and raised just outside of Pittsburgh, and is a West Point graduate, a Gulf War veteran and recipient of the Bronze Star. He and his wife, Dina, are the parents of six daughters. In September 2023, McCormick announced his second U.S. Senate campaign. He is seeking to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey Jr. in the 2024 election&hellip; - From @DaveMcCormickPA : Yesterday: Joe Biden unlocks billions for Tehran.

I&rsquo;ll fight to lower the cost of gas, groceries and rent and reign in government spending. - From @DaveMcCormickPA : Joe Biden and Bob Casey are misleading the American people instead of taking responsibility for recklessly spending trillions of taxpayer dollars and creating out-of-control inflation. Both should stop the &ldquo;shrinkflation&rdquo; charade and own up to their actions. - From @DaveMcCormickPA : He&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s past time for Bob Casey to agree. From @DaveMcCormickPA : Joe Biden is showing us who he stands with in this horrible situation &mdash; and it&rsquo;s not Laken Riley&rsquo;s memory or her family.

Rush $10, $15, or ANY AMOUNT to help Dave SURGE ahead & flip the Senate! Thank you for your support! DONATE More About Dave McCormick My name is Dave McCormick and I&rsquo;m running for the U.S. Senate. I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that. Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, as it stands today, those dreams are at risk. We are at a breaking point and the direction we choose to go will chart the course for the future of Pennsylvania and our country. Time and again, America has proved resilient in the face of adversity. I have a plan and the experience to move our commonwealth forward. I am a battle-tested leader who is ready to fight for YOU.

Military leaders are focused on promoting the woke agenda instead of combat training and military readiness, with recruitment reaching dangerous lows. A record number of illegal immigrants are being apprehended at the Southern border. Pro-Hamas rallies in the streets and on college campuses are stoking a rise in antisemitism following the horrific October 7 terrorist attacks on our ally, Israel. It&rsquo;s time to WAKE UP and reverse the damage that has been done before it&rsquo;s too late! That starts with every patriot stepping up right now to help take back the U.S. Senate so we can enact legislation that gets to the heart of the issues that matter most. >> HELP WIN BACK THE SENATE << You can join me in the fight against the Left&rsquo;s takeover of America today by helping Republicans pick up a KEY battleground Senate seat in Pennsylvania. Through your support of Dave McCormick today, you will not only be joining me on the front lines of this fight against the Left&rsquo;s woke agenda, but you'll also be helping Republicans win back the Senate in 2024! >> SUPPORT DAVE MCCORMICK << The Democrats are on a warpath to destroy our liberties and individualism that made America great. Dave is a battle-tested leader who will fight to secure the border, restore our economy, stand up to China, and support law and order once he gets to the Senate. So much is at risk in the 2024 elections. The Democrats are fighting hard to take away my Senate seat, but they will stop at NOTHING to defend their vulnerable incumbents like Senator Bob Casey in Pennsylvania. Rush a donation of $15, $35, or even $50 today to help Dave flip Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Senate seat and win us the majority! Don&rsquo;t forget, Jenga, Democrats only control the Senate by ONE SEAT. Your generous donation will make all the difference in helping the Republicans take back the majority and stand up against the woke activism that is working its way into our everyday lives. Can I count on you today? I hope you agree that we can't leave this upcoming election to chance and choose to take action today.

Dave&rsquo;s first bus tour of the campaign is rolling. This weekend, Dave has stopped in Berks, Snyder, and Union counties as part of his months-long tour of all 67 counties in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Dave literally and figuratively wants to keep the momentum going! We know some of you will not be able to see him on his tour, so we wanted to give you a chance to endorse Dave as he travels around Pennsylvania spreading his message about bringing REAL leadership to Washington. Will you sign your name to show Dave that loyal supporters like you are supporting him in this race? SIGN YOUR NAME TO ENDORSE DAVE We are going to show Dave this list before his next event, so we would really appreciate it if you could sign to endorse Dave. Thank you for being a dedicated member of Team McCormick! Together, we can take back Pennsylvania, the Senate Majority, and our country. Thank you, Team McCormick More About Dave McCormick My name is Dave McCormick and I&rsquo;m running for the U.S. Senate. I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that. Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, as it stands today, those dreams are at risk. We are at a breaking point and the direction we choose to go will chart the course for the future of Pennsylvania and our country. Time and again, America has proved resilient in the face of adversity. I have a plan and the experience to move our commonwealth forward. I am a battle-tested leader who is ready to fight for YOU. With Democrats holding the Senate Majority by just one seat, the significance of this Senate race will shape our future, for better or for worse.

And if we can take Pennsylvania with Dave McCormick, that will be a pretty good indication of a blowout night for the Republicans and Dave McCormick.&rdquo; - Mark Levin Friend, If you thought Mark Levin was talking about Joe & Hunter Biden, you&rsquo;re mistaken. He was talking about Bob Casey, a rubber stamp DC politician who has spent 17 years in DC with NOTHING to show for it. Mark knows Pennsylvania.

Don&rsquo;t take our word for it! Mark Levin hit the nail on the head when he told Dave that Democrats will throw everything they have into this race because they can&rsquo;t afford to lose Pennsylvania! Schumer&rsquo;s allies have already committed to OBLITERATING Dave&rsquo;s chances of winning this race. They have an army of liberal activists across the country who have already launched attack ads on Dave because they know he can win this race. And when he does, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to keep their Senate Majority! We&rsquo;re calling on every conservative reading this to rush an immediate donation of $10, $25, or more to help us win this race. &ldquo;He's [Bob Casey] running against really a Democrat leftist who pretends to be a mainstream center, left union supporting Democrat when he is attacking every household in the state of Pennsylvania Union, non-union, white collar, blue collar says nothing about what's going on with the Democrats in these cities who lead these cities and are destroying these cities like my home, city of Philadelphia, the guy just as lazy. He votes as he's told the vote.&rdquo; - Mark Levin For too long, career politicians like Bob Casey have ignored the real problems Americans are facing every day. They set their sights on grand progressive crusades that have shattered the American Dream. Dave McCormick is running to restore the core American values of liberty, opportunity, and individualism that make our country EXCEPTIONAL. But this won&rsquo;t be an easy race. That&rsquo;s why we are asking you to chip in NOW. Year after year, Democrats raise early money and crush Republicans in swing states like Pennsylvania. But with you on board, Friend, we&rsquo;ll have the resources necessary to have a blowout night for Republicans.

We sure are as you&rsquo;ll see in this Team McCormick Weekly Rundown. Here&rsquo;s what Dave has been up to&hellip; Op-Ed: A rescue plan for American energy and the environment Dave McCormick Pittsburgh Post Gazette The science is clear: climate change is happening, and human activity is one of many contributing factors. That should not be controversial. The key question is what to do about this reality. There are two competing approaches to this challenge. One seeks to overhaul and constrain America&rsquo;s energy industry from Washington in the name of fighting climate change. The other unleashes American energy production and innovation to power growth, create good jobs, and reduce our dependence on China, all while protecting the environment at the same time. Unleashing production In a speech last Friday in Pittsburgh, I laid out why the second approach is the best path and offered three steps to make America an energy superpower. The first step is to unlock oil and gas production here at home. &hellip; Next, we should embrace an &ldquo;all-of-the-above&rdquo; energy approach that provides market-driven support to clean energy alternatives, including nuclear. &hellip; Good stewards &hellip; Finally, we must leverage our abundant resources as a source of geopolitical strength. &hellip; The solutions to climate change won\\'t come from top-down direction from Washington that impose choices, pay subsidies, and deprive people of affordable energy. By relying on market forces, along with American innovation and ingenuity, we can make the United States an energy superpower &mdash; enhancing our economy and creating jobs, strengthening our security, and combating climate change. [Jump to Dave in the Local Media for the full article] - From @DaveMcCormickPA : Joe Biden and Bob Casey\\'s anti-fossil fuel agenda isn&rsquo;t just preventing us from being energy dominant &mdash; it&rsquo;s bleeding into every aspect of American life.

Senate candidate McCormick says less red tape, more gas, are key to Pa.&rsquo;s economic future Oliver Morrison 90.5 WESA Republican U.S. Senate candidate Dave McCormick says Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future economic prosperity will depend on whether its energy industry can grow even faster than it already has. The United States is currently the largest energy producer in the world, and has never produced more oil and gas than now. And during a speech in Downtown Pittsburgh Friday. McCormick acknowledged that Pennsylvania is already the second-largest producing state in the country. But he maintained that&rsquo;s despite the policies of Democrats like Joe Biden, not because of them. &ldquo;The single most important thing, and the only thing stopping us from becoming energy-dominant, is ourselves&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It\\'s red tape. It\\'s backward thinking. It\\'s the lack of imagination.&rdquo; In a nod to environmental concerns that surround the burning of fossil fuels, McCormick acknowledged that the world is getting warmer, but did not concede that human energy consumption is the main driver of climate change. He said only that &ldquo;human activity is one of the many contributing factors&rdquo; to rising global temperatures&hellip; - From @DaveMcCormickPA : Pittsburgh\\'s Jewish leaders are rightfully fed up with Summer\\'s Lee&rsquo;s antisemitism.

Daily on Energy: McCormick and Casey clash on energy in Pennsylvania Breanne Deppisch Washington Examiner MCCORMICK VERSUS CASEY ON ENERGY: Dave McCormick, the leading GOP candidate vying for Sen. Bob Casey&rsquo;s seat in Pennsylvania, gave a speech in Pittsburgh Friday outlining his energy platform and taking several jabs at President Joe Biden for his decision to pause LNG exports. But McCormick also took the chance to hit Casey on his record, arguing the incumbent hasn&rsquo;t done enough to advance oil and gas production &ndash; a notable line of attack, considering Pennsylvania is the second-largest producer of natural gas after Texas. Here&rsquo;s a snippet of what was said: &ldquo;Oil and gas production is rising in spite of, not because of, the policies that Senator Casey has supported. He has consistently voted against expediting oil and gas leases on federal lands. After previously supporting the project, Casey voted in lock step with President Biden against approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have made us less reliant on the Middle East. And when the Administration announced it would stop approving terminals to export American natural gas to the world, a decision that will actually hurt, not help, the environment, Senator Casey put out a statement expressing concern about the decision but has done nothing to take concrete action. That&rsquo;s weakness, not leadership.&rdquo;. Biden sanctuary city pivot puts vulnerable Senate Democrats\\' stances in spotlight Julia Johnson Fox News On Wednesday, Fox News Digital asked several Democratic senators in competitive states whether they agreed with the White House\\'s shift toward encouraging local jurisdictions to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Bob Casey, D-Pa., joined Tester\\'s opposition to sanctuary policies via a statement from spokesperson Maddy McDaniel. \"Senator Casey doesn&rsquo;t support sanctuary cities.\" This Monday&rsquo;s Question of the Week was very affirmative. When we dove more into sanctuary cities and how they enable the crisis at the border, an overwhelming majority of you had the same response. See below for the results: &rarr; 98% of you said that you think we need to crack down on sanctuary cities &rarr; 2% of you said that you don&rsquo;t think we need to crack down on sanctuary cities Here are some other issues you said you would like Dave to talk about: - Joanne S: &ldquo;It all is heartbreaking.&rdquo; - Don P: &ldquo;Enforcement of immigration laws and border controls will decrease crimes.&rdquo; - Brigid C: &ldquo;Cities and states across the country should always put the wellbeing of its citizens first. They should never support illegal immigrants with tax-paying dollars or shelter them from the law of the land. Sanctuary cities need to be held accountable, and fined and have federal funding/support removed immediately. &rdquo; - John T: &ldquo;Simple solution: sanctuary cities should lose ALL federal funding. I do not want our tax dollars supporting their foolishness.&rdquo; - David T: &ldquo;What right does a city or state have to protect criminals? If they are illegally entering the US, they are committing a crime.&rdquo; - Verlyn F: &ldquo;Illegal immigrants should not have sanctuary cities nor should they have billions of dollars of benefits paid for by the citizens of this country.&rdquo; Dave agrees with you and finds this situation heartbreaking. If elected, he will work tirelessly to ensure Americans are safe and the laws are enforced, especially when it comes to securing the border. Keep an eye out for next week&rsquo;s Question of the Week in your inbox every Monday to let Dave know what you think.

I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you\\'d find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I\\'m a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world\\'s largest investment firms. I\\'ve truly lived the American Dream, and my life\\'s journey reflects that.

Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib when Israel blocked their visits - Voted with President Biden 98% of the time There is no doubt that Hamas is a proxy that receives funding from Iran which is why I have a simple message for Bob Casey and other elected leaders in Washington: BLOCK EVERY DAMN DOLLAR.

I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that. Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania.

After Hamas&rsquo;s October 7 terrorist attacks resulted in the murder of over 1400 Israelis, Jewish Americans are looking to their elected leaders to stand with Israel and bring moral clarity to this situation. Bob Casey&rsquo;s actions and voting record fail on all accounts: - Refused to BLOCK $6 billion in funds that President Biden promised to Iran- Voted to support President Obama&rsquo;s Iran nuclear deal on THREE different occasions - Supported lifting sanctions on Iran that resulted in access to billions of dollars - Sided with Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib when Israel blocked their visits - Voted with President Biden 98% of the time There is no doubt that Hamas is a proxy that receives funding from Iran which is why I have a simple message for Bob Casey and other elected leaders in Washington: BLOCK EVERY DAMN DOLLAR.

We want people here who love America, not people who hate our great country.

The idea that if you worked hard you could provide a good life for yourself and your family. This country affords the greatest opportunities to live, work, and raise a family.

I want to take a moment to shout out all the folks who are raising kids on their own I know it's not easy, and I'll always work as hard in the Senate as y'all do for your families. I'm the proud son of a single mom who taught in public schools and sometimes took on a second job to make ends meet. My mom was my biggest hero growing up, and I am where I am today because of her love, hard work, and sacrifices. Thanks to my mom, my aunt and uncle, my teachers and coaches, and the good folks at our local YMCA, I earned a full ride football scholarship to Baylor and went on to play in the NFL. Then, I fulfilled another dream: I became a civil rights lawyer and went on to serve in the Obama administration. I was elected to Congress, in the district where I was born and raised, and now have the chance to run for Senate. I know my story is only possible in this country, and I'm fighting to make sure more kids have the chance to chase their version of the American dream. I've made it this far because of the help I've had along the way, and nowI'm relying on supporters like you to help me make it to the U.S. Senate.I'm running against Ted Cruz because I know who we are as Texans, and I believe we're better than his divisive partisanship. I'm proud that I'm the most bipartisan member of the Texas delegation, and I'm working to bring real solutions to our state. Because when you're raised by a single mom, you don't have time to argue about theoretical ideas that aren't going to become law. You have to actually get things done. I know that a single mom is sitting out there hoping her legislators are working as hard as she is, and I'm determined to be the leader she deserves. Ted Cruz spends his time starting culture wars instead of fighting for what working families need: lower costs, quality education, and affordable health care. He's attacking voting rights and abortion access instead of finding bipartisan solutions to the issues facing Texas. He's abandoning us when we need him most. If you're as ready as I am to fire Ted Cruz and bring real leadership to Texas, I need you to chip in $5 or more to my campaign today. We're closer than ever to sending him packing two recent polls showed us tied but it's going to take a Texas-sized outpouring of grassroots support to get it done. Can I count on you to be a part of it? Every dollar makes a difference in a battleground race like this one. Thank you so much for your support. Let's do this.

At every stop, I've met undecided Texans talking about the change we desperately need in Texas getting us one step closer to defeating Ted Cruz! But here's the bad news: Our fundraising numbers are not looking good. If Ted Cruz and his cronies get a glimpse of these numbers, they'll be licking their lips with excitement. Voter outreach is expensive and TV ads, campaign events, yard signs, and mailers add up FAST. That's why I'm personally asking: Can you give $5 right now to help us continue to reach undecided voters? We need to raise $65,000 every day to keep reaching voters across the state, but right now, we're falling short. I'm continually amazed at the power of the grassroots movement we've built together. We have a long way to go but I'm so grateful to have you on my team. -Colin Friend, two recent polls have shown us tied with Ted Cruz which means that this race is going to come down to who can reach the most voters before Election Day.

I'm counting onyouto help me compete.So please,can you give $5, $25, or whatever you can spare to keep my critical voter outreach going?

Extremist mega donors have poured more than $46 MILLION into Cruz's campaign, which is $13 million more than any other Senate candidate has raised. Despite the millions Cruz has in his campaign war chest, Colin is still TIED with him in the polls. But this is going to be one of the most expensive races in the country, and Colin is counting on grassroots support to keep up with Cruz and his extremist mega donors. That's why we're asking YOU to chip in now to help reach our $65,000 daily fundraising goal. Small-dollar donations from hardworking folks like you are how we're going to compete with Ted Cruz's massive war chest, so please, rush $5 or anything you can spare to make sure we have what it takes to fire Ted Cruz this November. Look, we knew this race wasn't going to be easy. Thankfully, Colin is no stranger to being the underdog, and he's not afraid of a tough fight. In 2018, he defeated a 22-year Republican incumbent to flip TX-32, and believe it or not, our chances against Ted Cruz are already better than they were in that 2018 race. Political experts across the country agree Colin can win. Ted Cruz won his last race by just 2.6%, CNN named Ted Cruz the most vulnerable Republican Senator in the country, and FiveThirtyEight reported this could be Democrats' best chance to pick up a seat. What's more, winning here would virtually guarantee Democrats protect our Senate majority. But Ted Cruz's wealthy allies know all this, too, and they're ready to spend whatever it takes to keep him in office. They've already launched their first attack ads, and it's going to be nonstop from now until Election Day which is why we really can't afford to miss this daily goal. Colin's counting on grassroots supporters like YOU to help him fight back against Cruz and his wealthy allies: So please, rush $5 or more by midnight so we can make sure Colin has the resources he needs to send Ted Cruz packing!

They know just how vulnerable Cruz is, and they'll spare no expense to reelect him and take back the Senate majority. That's why it's so important that we hit our fundraising goals every single dayto keep this momentum going: Please, will you rush $5, $25, or whatever you can spare to help me defeat Ted Cruz? I know we can win this thing, fire Ted Cruz, and give Texans the leadership we deserve. Thank you.

Now, the real fight begins. I'm ready to outwork, outraise, and out-organize Ted Cruz to win this thing, and with multiple polls already showing me TIED with Ted, I'm confident we can do it. But I also know Cruz is backed by wealthy mega donors who will spend whatever it takes to keep him in office. Thats why I need you with me from day one: Please, will you chip in $5 or whatever you can spare to help reach my critical fundraising goal before midnight so we can defeat Ted Cruz? Every dollar you can spare will help power our people-powered movement through Election Day so we can defeat Ted Cruz and deliver better, stronger leadership for the people of Texas. Will you help kick our campaign off in a huge way by donating $5 or more right now? Im a fourth generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas by a single mom. My mom was a public school teacher and sometimes worked two jobs to make ends meet. Thanks to my family and a strong support system of teachers, coaches, and the good folks at the YMCA, I earned a full-ride football scholarship to Baylor University and then went on to play in the NFL. But playing football was never my only dream from a young age I knew I wanted to help people. So I became a civil rights attorney to defend what I believe is our most fundamental right: the right to vote. I proudly served in President Obamas administration before I came home to Dallas, where my wife, Aly, and I are now raising our family. I ran for Congress in 2018 because I wanted more kids in North Texas to have the opportunity to achieve their version of the American dream. I also saw that our democracy was in peril and wanted to be part of protecting it. No one gave me a chance in that race, but I beat the odds to defeat an 11-term Republican incumbent. Since then, I'm proud to have been named the most bipartisan member of the Texas Congressional delegation. Now, Im ready for my next challenge: firing Ted Cruz and being the leader all Texans can count on in the Senate. We're already better off than we were in my race in 2018, with experts calling Cruz the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country, and two polls in a row showing us tied. I'm not saying it will be easy, but with you on my grassroots team, I know we can get it done, friend. Thats why Im asking you to chip in right now to become a General Election Founding Donor. We need an unprecedented grassroots movement to unseat Ted Cruz, and Im counting on you to be a part of it. Please, rush $5, or whatever you can spare, to help me win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz, and give Texans the leadership we deserve. Thank you so much for being a part of my team.

I have been blown away by the outpouring of support from folks who are fired up to defeat Ted Cruz, but we can't afford to slow down for one second. So I'm personally asking if you'll donate just $5 right now to help us keep the momentum going and take the lead: Our decisive victory in Tuesday's primary has kicked this race into high gear. TWO recent polls show me TIED with Ted Cruz, who CNN has named the most vulnerable Republican Senator in America. We've come such a long way since launching this campaign last May, all because of grassroots supporters like you, friend. I'm so proud that my campaign is powered by $5 and $10 donations to emails like this one.

Weve set a goal to raise $100,000 today, and your support is so important if were going to get there: Will you please make your first gift of$5, $10, or whatever you can to help me reach our first major General Election goal and make sure we have the resources to take on Ted Cruz and his big money donors?

I need your help to make sure these attacks don't go unanswered, so my team and I set a rapid-response goal to raise $100,000 by midnight: Will you rush $5 or more to help me fight back? Look, as a former NFL linebacker I've taken on guys a lot tougher than Ted Cruz and I'm not scared of him or his deep-pocketed buddies. I'm ready to fight back against whatever lies and disinformation they throw at me, but I need your help. To win here in Texas, we need to spend the next eight months pounding the pavement to knock doors from Amarillo to El Paso, making thousands of phone calls, and airing TV ads in some of the most expensive media markets in America. I simply can't do all that without your help, friend. So please, will you chip in $5, $25, or anything you can spare today to help me fight back against Ted Cruz's attack ads, win this race, and finally give Texans the leadership we deserve?

Let me tell you why your support is so important. The race to defeat Ted Cruz doesn't just concern Texans it concerns the future of our democracy. Our country can't handle six more years of Ted Cruz, his attacks on reproductive freedoms, his dismantling of our fundamental voting rights, and his endless self-centered antics. He's proven time and time again that his only loyalty is to himself, not the people he's supposed to represent. It's time to send him packing. Not only because Texans deserve so much better but because if Colin wins, Democrats are virtually guaranteed to retain control of the Senate, which is our last line of defense against the far right. Colin can win this Cruz won by just 2.6% of the vote in 2018. Election experts know it, and recent polling numbers show them TIED. But he'll need a massive movement of grassroots supporters behind him to help him reach voters, pull ahead, and win. That starts today with you, friend.

Im proud to endorse him, and I hope youll join me in supporting his campaign with a donation today. In one of the closest statewide elections in Texas history, we came within just 2.6 points of defeating Cruz in 2018. And in the six years since, Texans have put in the work to register and organize the voters we need to get the job done this year. While Cruzs campaign is largely funded by a handful of GOP mega donors, Colin is relying on grassroots supporters like you to win this race and make his campaign truly representative of the people of Texas.

He needs to raise $65,000 every single day to keep this campaign running. Please, read an important message from Colin below and chip in $5 or $10 to help him win in Texas: Friend, nothing prepared me for the hollow feeling I woke up with on Nov. 9, 2016 the day after Donald Trump was elected. At the time, I was working in President Obama's administration, and I couldn't believe our country had made so much progress, only to elect someone who wanted to take us backward. I couldn't help but question if I could have done more if we all could have done more to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. I didn't know it that day, but Trump's election and the dangerous direction he and his far-right supporters took our country in would be one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress. I couldn't stand what was happening, and I had to do whatever I could to change it. Turns out, a lot of people felt the same way I did and that's how we defeated a 22-year GOP incumbent, elected me as TX-32s first ever Democratic Congressman, and won back the House for Democrats in 2018. My motivation remains the same in this race. For over a decade, I've watched Ted Cruz fail Texans time and again. I know I can do better, and I know Texans are ready for change. But this race is going to come down to a handful of votes, and Ted Cruz has special interests and mega donors lining his pockets to crush our grassroots movement. He's got over $6.5 MILLION in the bank, and I've got to hit my critical deadlines just to keep up. I know I don't want to wake up the day after Election Day on Nov. 6 wishing we had done more to defeat Ted Cruz, friend. That's why I have to ask: Will you donate $5, $10, or any amount you can spare to support my campaign?

And what if I told you that after months of trailing, two recent polls show us TIED? Would you give just $5 to help ensure I have the resources I need to take the lead? I know $5 might not seem like much, but that's what this grassroots campaign is made of: $5 and $10 donations from folks like you who are sick and tired of Ted Cruz's culture wars and extremism.

It's never been more clear that we can beat Ted Cruz.His last race was one of the closest Senate races Texas has ever seen he won by just over 2%! And now, with our polls tied, CNN has named Cruz the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country. Cruz and his allies are scared right now, friend, and that means the money is about to start pouring in. Right-wing donors have already dumped more than $46 million into Cruz's campaign because they know just how vulnerable Ted really is.

GOP mega donors have already poured more than $46 MILLION into his campaign, and as you read this, they're flooding him with even more to try to defeat Colin.

Colin Allred is a public servant through and through. That became clear when he was the DFW regional voter protection director for my gubernatorial campaign in 2014, and it\\'s why I endorsed him for Congress in 2018 when he defied the odds to defeat a 22-year Republican incumbent. And now, as he has become the official Democratic nominee against Ted Cruz, I proudly stand by Colin as the best choice to represent the people of Texas and defend our fundamental reproductive freedoms. I know he can defeat the anti-choice extremist Ted Cruz who won his last election by just 2.6% but it won\\'t be easy. It\\'s going to take a huge movement of grassroots supporters behind him every step of the way and that starts with hitting his $1 million General Election Kickoff goal. So please:Will you chip in $5, or whatever you can, to help Colin reach voters, pull ahead, and defeat Ted Cruz? Friend, when Roe was overturned in 2022, Ted Cruz called it \"nothing short of a massive victory.\" And since that moment, he\\'s kept his far-right benefactors happy by attacking our reproductive freedoms and stripping away women\\'s rights for his own political gain. I don\\'t have to tell you that Texans deserve so much better than Ted Cruz. He\\'s attacked not only our right to choose but also the rights of our LGBTQ+ neighbors. He abandoned the people of Texas during a devastating winter storm when we needed him most, and he\\'s more concerned with his podcast than taking care of the people he represents. Right now, we\\'re closer than ever to sending Ted Cruz packing and electing a leader who will fight for the freedoms that matter to us. Elections experts agree that Colin can win but he needs to build a winning movement of supporters, a movement that starts with you, friend. We can\\'t let this opportunity to defeat Ted Cruz pass.

We are all invested in this campaign because we know we can do better than Tez Cruz and his self-serving politics. When I was in the NFL, we had a word for guys like Ted who put themselves above the team: me-guys. Me-guys are the folks you dont want to get stuck talking to at a barbecue, the ones who talk a big game but dont show up when its time to do the hard work. Thats why Im running to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate: to give Texas a Senator who will actually fight for us, stand up for our freedoms, and do whats best for Texas. But I cant beat the ultimate me-guy, Ted Cruz, by myself, friend. It will take all of us working to build the largest grassroots movement in Texas history together WE must knock doors, make phone calls, and reach Texans where they are so we arent embarrassed by our Senator anymore.

Now, Im ready for my next challenge: firing Ted Cruz and being the leader all Texans can count on in the Senate. We're already better off than we were in my race in 2018, with experts calling Cruz the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country, and two polls in a row showing us tied. I'm not saying it will be easy, but with you on my grassroots team, I know we can get it done, friend. Thats why Im asking you to chip in right now to become a General Election Founding Donor and help reach our ambitious $1 million goal. We need an unprecedented grassroots movement to unseat Ted Cruz, and Im counting on you to be a part of it. Please, rush $5, or whatever you can spare, to help me win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz, and give Texans the leadership we deserve. Thank you so much for being a part of my team.

I am so grateful to my fellow Texas voters and grassroots supporters like you for entrusting me with this honor I will not let you down. I'm ready to outwork Ted Cruz to win this thing because the stakes of this election are too high not to. From voting rights to abortion, our freedoms are under attack. Everyday costs are still too high. Simply put: Texans cannot afford six more years of Ted Cruz. Thats why this campaign is so important. Two recent polls showed us tied with Cruz, and I know we can win this race but I need you with me to do it. So I have to ask, friend: Will you donate $5 or $25 right now to help me keep up tonight's momentum all the way through Election Day?

I never knew my dad but thanks to my community of teachers, coaches and counselors at the YMCA, who helped my mom, aunt and uncle raise me, I had the opportunity to chase my version of the American Dream. Without them, I never would've made it to the NFL, gone to law school, become a civil rights lawyer, served in the Obama Administration, or run against a 22-year GOP incumbent and won, becoming the first Democrat to ever represent TX-32 in Congress. And thanks to them, I am where I am today: the official Democratic nominee who has the chance to become Texas first Black Senator. The chance to finally defeat Ted Cruz and give Texans the committed leadership we deserve. With experts calling Ted Cruz the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country and two polls showing us TIED, the only thing that could hold us back is resources. Its true that everything is bigger in Texas, and this campaign is no exception. Its going to take the biggest grassroots movement Texas has ever seen to beat Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz already has more than $6.5 million in the bank to attack me with, so please: Will you chip in $5, $25, or any amount before midnight tonight to make sure I have the resources to fight back against Ted Cruz's attacks, reach voters across Texas, and win? Your support would mean so much as we work to give Texans the leadership we need and deserve. Thank you so much for being a part of this team. Let's do this. Colin P.S.

All the way back in 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels, a pastor and State Senator from Mississippi, was elected as the first Black U.S. Senator. Since then, we've come a long way as a country. But representation like our democracy is a work in progress, and I believe we can do better. Black Americans have long facedfar too many obstacles like discrimination, lower pay, and higher job instability not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents. Im ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfect union for my boys and every kid in Texas. And our hard work is already paying off a brand-new poll from last week shows this race in a dead heat, with me and Ted Cruz tied at 41%.

I was elected to Congress, in the district where I was born and raised, and now have the chance to run for Senate and become my state's first Black Senator. I know my story is only possible in this country and that my path says more about my community and Texas than it does about me because I relied on the folks around me every step of the way.

I'm a fourth-generation Texan. My family's from Brownsville. I grew up in Dallas and am proud to be raising my boys here with my wife Aly; I went to school in Waco and trained for the NFL draft in Houston. I'm proud to represent North Texas in the House, and I'm especially proud that I'm the most bipartisan member of the Texas delegation. Because when you're raised by a single mom, you don't have time to argue about theoretical ideas that aren't going to become law. You have to actually get things done. I know that single mom is sitting out there hoping her legislators are working as hard as she is. And I'm determined to be the leader she deserves. Ted Cruz, on the other hand, is out there starting culture wars instead of fighting for what working families need: better wages, affordable health care, and investments in Texas. He's attacking voting rights and reproductive freedom instead of advocating for reliable child care and for our kids to be safe in their schools. He's abandoning us when we need him most.

I don't want to wake up wondering if I could've done more to help folks make it to the polls. That's why I'm personally asking:Will you chip in $5 or more to help reach my critical $500,000 end-of-month goal so we can fire Ted Cruz this November? Here's the truth: We're closer than ever to defeating Ted Cruz. He won by just 2.6% in 2018, and polls show us TIED right now at 44% each. If we can just keep up our momentum through Election Day, we can finally send Cruz packing and give Texans the leadership we deserve. But it's going to take a massive amount of grassroots resources. Ted Cruz has wealthy extremists and special-interest allies bankrolling his campaign and more than $6.5 million in the bank. I have this grassroots team, and I'm counting on you to come through now. So please, will you chip in today?Every dollar gets us closer to defeating Ted Cruz let's leave it all on the field and make sure we have no regrets on Nov. 6. Thanks for being on my team.

Warnock, and I'm reaching out today on behalf of my good friend Congressman Colin Allred who is running to defeat Ted Cruz and become the first Black Senator from Texas. I've always believed that our government is stronger when it reflects the diversity of our country. That's what those who doubted my run for the Senate failed to grasp, and that's what GOP extremists like Ted Cruz miss when they pass laws that punish working people of color and make it harder for certain folks to vote. I'm proud of the work weve done to protect the sacred right to vote and build an economy that works for families on Main Street, not Wall Street. But every day, folks like Ted Cruz are fighting to roll our progress back, meaning our work to defend it is far from done. And look, I know what it takes to win a race like this, and trust me Colins got what it takes. But he cant do it alone. That's why I'm asking you to make a donation to my friend Colin Allred, who needs your help to defeat Ted Cruz and become the first Black Senator from Texas. Friend, Texans have made it loud and clear they're ready for new leadership. Right now, Colin and Ted Cruz are tied, and we're so close to finally kicking Ted out of the Senate for good. But the GOP has millionaire donors at their beck and call, and to defeat them, it's going to take a huge movement of grassroots donors to stand with us.

All the way back in 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels, a pastor and State Senator from Mississippi, was elected as the first Black U.S. Senator. Since then, we've come a long way as a country. But representation like our democracy is a work in progress, and I believe we can do better. Black Americans have long facedfar too many obstacles like: discrimination, lower pay, higher job instability not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents. Im ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfect union for my boys and every kid in Texas. And our hard work is already paying off a brand-new poll from last week shows this race in a dead heat, with me and Ted Cruz tied at 44%.

He needs to raise $65,000 every single day to keep this campaign running. Please, read an important message from Colin below and chip in $5 or $10 to help him win in Texas: Friend, nothing prepared me for the hollow feeling I woke up with on Nov. 9, 2016 the day after Donald Trump was elected. At the time, I was working in President Obama's administration, and I couldn't believe our country had made so much progress, only to elect someone who wanted to take us backward. I couldn't help but question if I could have done more if we all could have done more to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. I didn't know it that day, but Trump's election and the dangerous direction he and his far-right supporters took our country in would be one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress. I couldn't stand what was happening, and I had to do whatever I could to change it. Turns out, a lot of people felt the same way I did and that's how we defeated a 22-year GOP incumbent, elected me as TX-32s first ever Democratic Congressman, and won back the House for Democrats in 2018. My motivation remains the same in this race. For over a decade, I've watched Ted Cruz fail Texans time and again. I know I can do better, and I know Texans are ready for change. But this race is going to come down to a handful of votes, and Ted Cruz has special interests and mega donors lining his pockets to crush our grassroots movement. He's got over $6.2 MILLION in the bank, and I've got to hit my critical deadlines just to keep up. I know I don't want to wake up the day after Election Day on Nov. 6 wishing we had done more to defeat Ted Cruz, friend.

I'm a fourth-generation Texan. I'm the proud son of a single mom who taught in public schools and sometimes worked a second job just to make ends meet. Colin's mother holding him as a child Growing up, my world was pretty small. I never imagined I'd be working in the halls of Congress, let alone taking on Ted Cruz, hoping to become the first Black Senator from Texas. But I did dream of helping people whether it was as Superman or a firefighter. Colin at a young age dressed in a Superman costume After playing football at Baylor University and in the NFL, I went to law school and became a civil rights attorney, specializing in voting rights. I've watched this fundamental right be attacked and eroded my whole life right here in Texas we have some of the most restrictive voter laws in the country, and it's no secret that these laws target Black and brown voters. Colin and Congressman John Lewis It was one of the great honors of my life that one of my heroes and a voting rights and American giant, Congressman John Lewis, joined me on the campaign trail in 2018. I beat the odds and an 11-term GOP incumbent to win that race and help Democrats flip the House. Now, I'm ready to do it again and replace Ted Cruz in the U.S. Senate but I need your help. That's why I'm asking you to donate to my campaign today. We've all watched for 10 years as Ted Cruz has failed the people of Texas repeatedly. He's bowed down to Donald Trump, pushed dangerous conspiracy theories about the 2020 elections, cheered on the rioters that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, and abandoned our state while Texans froze in the dark. To add insult to injury, after we passed critical voting rights legislation in the House, he spearheaded the effort to kill it in the Senate. Time and time again, Ted Cruz has made it clear he will always put Ted Cruz first. That's not me. I'm running for Senate to be a voice for all Texans, for families like yours and mine, and I hope you'll help me get there, friend. Because the truth is, unseating Ted Cruz won't be easy. It's possible, if we all work together and amass a grassroots movement like Texas has never seen, but I need you with me. So please, will you chip in $5, $10, or whatever you can to help me defeat Ted Cruz once and for all? Every dollar makes a difference in our battleground race, and I truly appreciate it.

Please, read an important message from Colin below and chip in $5 or $25 to help him defeat Ted Cruz and win in Texas: Three years ago, a deadly winter storm devastated Texas, leaving millions of families without heat or electricity and taking the lives of hundreds. And how did our junior Senator, Ted Cruz, respond? Cruz hopped on a plane to vacation in Cancn, abandoning Texans when we needed him most. In times of crisis, there are so many things a United States Senator could be doing to help the people they were elected to serve. Going on vacation is not one. Friend, I will never abandon the people of Texas. When Im in the Senate, you can count on me to be here when we are in crisis and to work to ensure that we take the necessary steps to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. I will always put Texans first. We deserve so much better than Ted Cruz. And now that a new poll shows us exactly tied at 44%-44%, we're closer than ever to giving Texans the leadership we deserve. But here's the thing: Ted Cruz has special interest donors lined up to buy this Senate seat for him. The only way we're going to send him on a permanent vacation is if we can build a grassroots movement like Texas has never seen before and that's where you come in, friend. That's why I have an important ask of you today: Will you chip in now to help make sure I have the resources to reach voters on their TV screens, at their doors and on the phones? Together, we can send Ted Cruz packing for good and ensure that the people of Texas aren't left high and dry again. Thank you, Colin - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

I wanted to take a quick moment to introduce myself and tell you why I'm working so hard to get Colin elected to the U.S. Senate. I joined Colin's team way back in 2018 during his first campaign for the House of Representatives. The first thing that struck me (well, besides the fact that he's about a foot and a half taller than me) was his focus and his determination. Colinis deeply connected to his roots and the community that helped raise him. He gets intense when talking about his upbringing as a biracial kid in Dallas growing up with a single mom. He knows it was rare and lucky for him to make it to the NFL and go on to become a civil rights lawyer. Of course he worked hard, but he also had a lot of help along the way from a strong community of coaches, teachers, and the folks at his local YMCA. Now, he's fighting to make sure his story isnt unique and that all Texas kids have the same support and opportunities. As a Congressman, he has worked tirelessly to make things a little bit better for people like the hardworking mom and community members that raised him. That's what Texans deserve from their Senator. That's pretty much his elevator pitch, and I was inspired enough by it to join his team even when, at that time, the experts gave us a 10% chance of winning. Colin's been an underdog all his life, so that number didn't phase him, and with a lot of hard work and, again, a lot of support from the same North Texas community that helped raise Colin, we beat the odds in that race to defeat a 22-year GOP incumbent. That's how I know we can beat the odds again this time around and defeat Ted Cruz. Our chances are already better than they were back then polls show us statistically tied, and after we launched this campaign, CNN named Ted the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country. But we need your help to get it done. We've seen it time and time again, in 2018 and in every race since: Grassroots support makes all the difference. Colin doesn't take corporate money, so he really and truly is depending on you to carry us through to Election Day. So please, friend, will you chip in $5, $25, or any amount you can spare today to help us finish the job and fire Ted Cruz? Thank you so much for being a part of this team. Colin really believes in a Texas where freedoms are protected and where if you work hard and play by the rules you can get ahead, and I believe that together, we can make it happen.

Going on vacation while millions of Texans are freezing in their homes without power is NOT something a United States Senator should be doing during times of crisis. But thats Ted Cruz for you: hes NOT in this to serve Texans he only cares about himself. Texans want, need, and deserve a Senator who will put us first a proven leader like Colin Allred. During the same storm, Colin was volunteering at the North Texas food bank to help get resources to Texans. He was on the phone with FEMA and county emergency management teams trying to get warming centers open. Thats the kind of leadership Texans deserve. But right now, Colin and Cruz are TIED 44%-44% in the polls and Colins counting on supporters like you to help him pull ahead. So please: Will you chip in $5 right now to help Colin and our team raise $65,000 by midnight to send Ted Cruz on a permanent vacation? Friend, Texas can't afford six more years of Ted Cruz. Colin Allred is our chance to finally give Texans a Senator who won't abandon us when we need him most. This election will all come down to who can reach the most voters by knocking on doors, running ads, and making calls but that takes a lot of resources. And in a race this close, every dollar will make or break who wins.

THEN: After Allred's record-setting 2023, a January poll showed that Cruz's lead had been cut to just 2 points and CNN named Cruz the most vulnerable GOP Senator in the country! NOW: A brand-new poll shows Colin TIED with Ted Cruz with hundreds of thousands of voters still undecided!

If you're already with me, will you make a donation to help power my grassroots campaign? All the way back in 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels, a pastor and State Senator from Mississippi, was elected as the first Black U.S. Senator. Since then, we've come a long way as a country. But representation like our democracy is a work in progress, and I believe we can do better. Black Americans have long facedfar too many obstacles like: discrimination, lower pay, higher job instability not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents. Im ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfect union for my boys and every kid in Texas. And our hard work is already paying off a brand-new poll from yesterday shows this race in a dead heat, with me and Ted Cruz tied at 44%. But unlike Ted Cruz, I dont have corporate special interests footing the bill for my campaign. To win, I need a massive movement of grassroots supporters to step up and join me in this fight.

I returned to work, despite the trauma, and watched horrified as those same members refused to take action or even denounce the violence. That day showed me just how fragile and precious our democracy is. We need fighters in Congress who are willing to show up to hold far-right extremists accountable. Im running because Im passionate about this and Im not going to sit back and wait for someone else to do it.

I'm also grateful for what he's doing for Texas families from bringing good-paying jobs to our state and working to make child care more affordable and improve paid family leave policies to protecting and expanding affordable health care. He's determined to make sure all Texas kids have the great support system and opportunities he did, and I truly admire his dedication.

I'm going to ask you to support my good friend Colin Allred's campaign to defeat Ted Cruz. But first, let me tell you why Colin is the steady leader we need in the Senate: I first met Colin when he worked as the DFW Regional Voter Protection Director for my campaign in 2014. Here's the thing about Colin: What you see is what you get Colin is a community servant before all else. I knew from the day I hired him (almost 10 years ago!) that he would do everything in his power to make sure Texans have every opportunity to succeed. That's why I was so proud to endorse him in 2018 when he decided to run for Congress and defied all odds to defeat a 22-year Republican incumbent. And it's why I'm thrilled to support Colin again now. He can defeat Ted Cruz if we give him the resources he needs to reach voters across Texas. That's why I'm personally asking you to support him, too. Please, will you chip in $5, or any amount, to help Colin send Ted Cruz packing once and for all? I'm sure I don't need to convince you how terrible Ted Cruz has been for Texans. His attacks on our reproductive freedom and LGBTQ+ rights, his support of outrageous book bans, his irresponsible trip to Cancun while a winter storm caused power outages across the state . I could go on and on, but the long and short of it is this: We need a new Senator, and Colin Allred is the real deal. Experts agree Texas is winnable. FiveThirtyEight called it Democrats' best pickup opportunity in 2024, and CNN says Cruz is the most vulnerable Republican Senator on the ballot.

Iplayed in the NFL and went on to serve in the administration of our nation's first Black president. I was elected to Congress, in the district where I was born and raised, and now have the chance to run for Senate and become my state's first Black Senator. I know my story is only possible in this country. And that my path says more about my community and Texas than it does about me because I relied on the folks around me every step of the way. I relied on my public schools. I relied on my teachers, my coaches, and my neighborhood YMCA. Now, I'm relying on supporters like you to help me make it to the U.S. Senate if you have a few dollars to spare today, I'd really appreciate it. I'm running against Ted Cruz because I know who we are as Texans, and I believe we're better than his divisive partisanship. I'm a fourth-generation Texan. My family's from Brownsville. I grew up in Dallas and am proud to be raising my boys here with my wife Aly, went to school in Waco, and trained for the NFL draft in Houston. I'm proud to represent North Texas in the House, and I'm especially proud that I'm the most bipartisan member of the Texas delegation. Because when you're raised by a single mom, you don't have time to argue about theoretical ideas that aren't going to become law. You have to actually get things done. I know that single mom is sitting out there hoping her legislators are working as hard as she is. And I'm determined to be the leader she deserves. Ted Cruz on the other hand is out there starting culture wars instead of fighting for what working families need: better wages, affordable health care, and investments in Texas. He's attacking voting rights and reproductive freedom instead of advocating for reliable child care and for our kids to be safe in their schools. He's abandoning us when we need him most. If you're as ready as I am to fire Ted Cruz and bring real leadership to Texas, I need you to chip in $5 or more to my campaign today. We're closer than ever to sending him packing a recent poll showed us statistically tied but it's going to take a Texas-sized outpouring of grassroots support to get it done. Can I count on you to be a part of it? Every dollar makes a difference in a battleground race like this one. Thank you so much for your support. Let's do this.

Friend, there's a reason why leaders across Texas and incredible organizations like the Human Rights Campaign and the Texas AFL-CIO are standing with Colin in his race against Ted Cruz: Teds loyalty lies with the special interests and mega donors that support him, not working families and his record in the Senate reflects that. But Colin is a fourth-generation Texan raised by a single mother who often worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. He knows that the majority of Texans are honest, hardworking people who deserve the opportunity to chase their own version of the American dream.

With a lot of hard work and support from my mom, coaches, and teachers, I earned a full football scholarship to Baylor and went on to play in the NFL. Then, I went to law school, became a civil rights attorney to protect voting rights, and served in the Obama administration. I ran for Congress because I dont want my story to be the exception I want all kids to have every opportunity to achieve their dreams.

Please, read an important message from Colin below and chip in $5 or $10 to help him win in Texas: Friend, nothing prepared me for the hollow feeling I woke up with on Nov. 9, 2016 the day after Donald Trump was elected. At the time, I was working in President Obama's administration, and I couldn't believe our country had made so much progress, only to elect someone who wanted to take us backward. I couldn't help but question if I could have done more if we all could have done more to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. I didn't know it that day, but Trump's election and the dangerous direction he and his far-right supporters took our country in would be one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress. I couldn't stand what was happening, and I had to do whatever I could to change it. Turns out, a lot of people felt the same way I did and that's how we defeated a 22-year GOP incumbent and elected me as TX-32s first ever Democratic Congressman and won back the House for Democrats in 2018. My motivation remains the same in this race. For the last decade, I've watched Ted Cruz fail Texans time and again. I know I can do better, and I know Texans are ready for change. But this race is going to come down to a handful of votes, and Ted Cruz has special interests and mega donors lining his pockets to crush our grassroots movement. He's got over $7.3 MILLION in the bank, and I've got to hit my critical deadlines just to keep up. I know I don't want to wake up the day after Election Day on Nov. 6th wishing we had done more to defeat Ted Cruz, friend.

You have to learn to work with people you dont see eye to eye with all the time, but you learn to value and respect your differences. Thats what I do every day representing TX-32 work with lawmakers I dont always agree with to make progress for families in my district and all Americans. I recognize that its not all about me, just like football was never all about me its about being a voice in Washington for the people we represent. But Ted Cruz is selfish. He puts himself first every single chance he gets, hes completely out of touch with what everyday Texans want and need, and hes shown time and time again that hes incapable of change or compromise. I've taken down way tougher guys than Ted in the NFL, and now I'm running to defeat him because I know we deserve better but I need your help to do it.

Not just because I hate to disappoint him but because every missed goal means that we could fall short in our efforts to knock enough doors, make enough calls, and buy enough airtime to reach the undecided voters we need to win and we risk falling so far behind that we never recover. So with our very first end-of-month deadline of the year approaching in just two days, I need your help: Will you make sure I don\\'t have to give Colin any more bad news? Please, rush $5 right now so that we can hit our $500,000 goal and continue to reach the critical voters we need on their TVs, online, and at their doors.

She raised me on her own, sometimes working two jobs to make ends meet. As a public school teacher, she taught me to value education; although I excelled in sports, homework always came first in our house. A lot of the policies I'm fighting for now affordable child care, universal pre-k, more support and opportunities for our kids are informed by the tough choices I watched her make while I was growing up. My world was small growing up. I don't remember traveling much farther than Brownsville, where my grandparents lived. But my love of reading and the strong community I found at our local YMCA made it feel bigger. I had a lot of support along the way to earn a full football scholarship to Baylor and eventually make it to the NFL I think that's what makes me so committed to fighting for today's kids. I don't want my story to be the exception; I want every kid to be supported and empowered to succeed. My wife, Aly, and our two boys inspire me to work harder and dream bigger every day. When we decided to have kids, I knew from day one that I wanted to be there for every moment, and I wanted us to be equal partners. That's a big part of what inspired me to become the first member of Congress to take paternity leave and make fighting for paid family leave a key priority. I'm telling you all this because it's all a big part of why I'm running for Senate to fight for families like yours and mine. And, yes, as a fourth-generation Texan, I'm also sick and tired of watching Ted Cruz trample over our rights and embarrass the Lone Star State every chance he gets. Friend, I know Texans are ready for change, and I've taken down guys a lot tougher than Ted Cruz before. But I need your help. Experts are calling Texas a battleground state, saying this could be one of the most competitive and most expensive races this cycle. It's going to take a historic outpouring of grassroots support to beat Ted Cruz, and I don't want to risk losing because we didn't have the resources we needed. So I'm personally asking, will you chip in $5 today to help me defeat Ted Cruz and be the senator Texas families deserve? Any amount you can spare is truly appreciated Thank you so much, Colin Allred - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

Today is the day. Let us break it down for you: This is the month that Kyrsten Sinema decided not to run for re-election. This is a race that will come down to Kari Lake or Ruben Gallego with the U.S. Senate on the line. This is the month that Kari Lake consolidated her grip on the GOP and the month they started committing big to her campaign. Republican elites raised $330,000 in one night for her, and theyve ponied up millions more in support down the line. This is the month that Ruben went up on television in Arizona and that means weve budgeted out millions of dollars to stay on the air. Thats the only way well win this race: Telling Rubens story, and fighting back against the attacks coming our way. So its been a big month. And weve set high goals this month, very real goals, ahead of our first official FEC deadline of the Election Year. Theyre not arbitrary. Theyre what we need to raise to win. And todays the day that were asking you to chip in that donation. Rubens counting on you, so please: Can you chip in whatever you can afford to Rubens campaign for U.S. Senate?

EVEN BETTER NEWS: Since Kyrsten Sinema dropped out of the race, weve been doing it through TONS of individual donations. Thats how we fund this campaign not through hedge funds or billionaire benefactors, but from YOU. THE BEST-BEST NEWS: When you fund a campaign that way we elect people who go to Washington and remember who sent them there. People that arent beholden to Super PACs or corporate special interests. People like Ruben. Our raise slowed down a bit since Kyrsten Sinemas announcement, so Ruben reached out last night. Since then, weve seen things pick right back up. Only one problem: Our average donation is down considerably over previous months. That means we have two options: We either need more folks to make their first donation online to make up for it, or we need our supporters to dig a little bit deeper and chip in more than they typically would. Thats the only way were going to hit our goals. So, how about it: Can you make a donation of at least $10? With 10 days to our deadline, the timing could not be more important.

Ever since Kari Lake entered the race, weve seen a steady stream of stories talking about how shes moderating her positions. Some kind of newer, friendlier Kari Lake. Well, lets take a look and see how thats going: 'Kari Lake wants Supreme Court to revive her case looking to block voting machines' Sounds like the same ol Kari Lake to us. Denying elections, supporting conspiracy theories, praising insurrectionists and every day, proudly supporting Donald Trump. Look, whoever wins in Arizona isnt just about a single seat in the Senate. In fact, its bigger than who controls the Senate, too. Victory or defeat in Arizona is going to decide who runs the country for the next four years. If we can defeat Kari Lake its that much more likely that we beat Trump for good. But if we lose Trump, Lake, and the MAGA-right are back in power. For that, and for so many other reasons we've got to do everything we can to make sure Ruben Gallego wins in Arizona. Please make a donation to Rubens campaign for U.S. Senate and help us stop this MAGA resurgence before its too late.

If everyone reading this donated even $10, we would not only have a huge number of donations, but we probably wouldn't have to ask again for weeks. But not everyone gives. So were relying on people who understand how important this race is, and how important keeping Kari Lake out of the Senate is, to chip-in today. Ruben doesnt do a ton of big-dollar fundraisers. This campaign is sustained by the donations of only 5% of Rubens supporters. Without those donations, big or small, we couldnt run a winning campaign. Thats why we need your help. We are passionate about our fundraising model, because at its core, this campaign is powered by you. Our average donation is $27. Many donors give less. Some give more. All that matters is that youre choosing to power this campaign today. If Ruben winning this race and keeping Kari Lake out of the Senate seems worth it to you, were humbly asking you to take a minute to secure the future of this campaign by making a donation. Thank you. DONATE: We are asking, humbly: please make your donation today. Itd mean a lot.

I'm running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. And me in Arizona. Both races we need to win in order for Democrats to keep the Senate. Both states Democrats need to win in order to defeat Donald Trump. Swing states. With polls showing incredibly close races. And our races have one more thing in common. Republicans also know how important they are -- and that is why they are going to spend ridiculous sums of money to defeat us. That's why we're coming to you today. To ask for help. Because neither of us will be able to win our races by ourselves. Can you please use this link to split a contribution to our campaigns for U.S. Senate? Do it before our FEC deadlines end and we're legally required to report our fundraising numbers for all to see. If everyone reading this chipped in even just a few bucks we'd each have the resources we need to win our races. But not everyone does.

People are pulling together behind Ruben, and its great to see. And it couldnt come at a better time, because weve had a lot of tough news lately. Several polls have shown Ruben trailing Kari Lake, and one of the most recent put them neck and neck: Kari Lake: 46% (+1) Ruben Gallego: 45% If were going to turn this around and help Ruben take the lead and WIN in Arizona, we need to keep up the momentum.

Standing on the House floor. Hearing shouts, pounding, breaking glass. Barricading the door, teaching my colleagues how to use their gas masks. Texting my staff, telling them to hide. I carried a rifle in Iraq and all I had to defend myself on January 6th was a pen. But I was ready to fight. And after that day, Trumps loyalists crawled right back to him. Witnessing them reject what they lived through, watching them ignore the testimony of the police officers that defended us that day while they were beaten, bloodied, pepper sprayed, cursed at it makes me sick. Kari Lake thinks the January Sixers are patriots who were invited in she even campaigns with them. I think anyone who supports those terrorists and traitors shouldnt be allowed anywhere near the U.S. Senate. This race in Arizona is just me and her. Its on us to stop her march to more power and influence. Whoever wins in Arizona is going to determine which party holds the Senate, and could even decide whether Trump takes back the White House.

If that's all you need to hear, use this link: Contribute: Otherwise, here's the deal: With Sinema out, that means Republicans can focus their negative attack ads on just one candidate. They don't have to attack Sinema anymore, they can just hammer Ruben. That means we are likely to get pummeled on the airwaves, and it will likely happen soon. So this request is important: Arizona is going to be one of the most contested and expensive Senate races in the country. What happens here will determine who controls the Senate, and probably the White House too. Republicans know this as well, so the attack ads are coming. And Ruben can't fight back without your help.

Trump needs to control the Senate if he has any shot at delivering on his radical agenda, and Arizona is the key to controlling the Senate. They know this as well as we do. So theyre not wasting any time. Kari Lake had a fundraiser in DC tonight with 16 Republican Senators and the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She probably raised a ton of cash at that fundraiser, and shell use every dollar to tear Ruben down. To stay competitive, we need to match her dollar-for-dollar. For every $1000 check, we need a hundred people chipping in $10. For every $10,000 check, we need five hundred people chipping in $20. If everybody reading this email chipped in tonight, wed blow this fundraiser out of the water and absolutely CRUSH our fundraising goal for this month. But thats the problem: Not everyone can donate.

One thing I knew for sure was that whether this was a 2-way race, a 3-way race, a 27-way race, whatever I was going to need the support of a huge grassroots team behind me. Over the last year weve built that team, with close to 150,000 individual donors. And now we know: Sinemas out. This race is a head-to-head between me and Kari Lake.

She cant win, but she could pull enough voters her way to give the edge to Kari Lake and that would be an absolute disaster. If she doesnt run, its just Ruben and Kari head-to-head in Arizona. That means the GOP establishment doesnt have to split their attacks between two candidates, and they can focus all of their efforts on tearing Ruben apart.

Arizona is the pick-up seat we need this year if were going to have any chance at holding the Senate. But theres some bad news: They polled the outlook for a race with Sinema running for re-election, too. And in a three-way race, our lead narrows considerably. Brings it neck-and-neck between Ruben and Kari. That reinforces what we already know, too: That if Kyrsten Sinema runs, she could peel enough voters off Ruben to hand this seat to Kari Lake. Heres what all that means: No matter who we run against Kari Lake, Kyrsten Sinema, whoever we have to be ready for anything.

Not with Kari Lake leading Ruben in every recent poll. Not with Trump focusing all his energy and effort on winning in Arizona a state he lost by just 11,000 votes in 2020. So heres what we need from you: $5. Thats what were asking you to donate to help Ruben take the lead and win in Arizona. Yes, $5 isnt the kind of money that can win a Senate race all by itself. But by the time youve gotten to this part of the email, a few dozen others have already chipped in. Theyre hoping youll join them and add your $5. Please, add your $5. Thats the only way we will win this campaign and defend our Senate majority. Contribute: Thank you for this. Your support means a lot to us, and to Ruben.

Weve got an incredible base of donors, weve got a strong team, and a sound strategy. Thats good, because if were going to have any chance at holding the Senate we MUST win in Arizona. BAD NEWS: Weve started this month off slower than we anticipated. Its not great, because were expecting millions of dollars in attack ads to come our way any day now. We have to hit each goal, one after another, to raise what we need to fight back and win in Arizona. Those goals arent arbitrary. So please, before the weekend, we need your help to catch up. We have to do it the only way we know how: with as many donations as we can possibly generate from the people who understand how important this race is. And thats why were asking: Can you make a contribution before the weekend to help Ruben catch up and hit his goals?

Kids that grow up like I did dont usually get to run for Senate. But Im a fighter. I fought hard to get into college. I fought in Iraq. I fought for the issues we care about in Congress. And I was ready to fight to defend the Capitol on January 6th. If I get to the U.S. Senate, Im going to fight for you. The math is really tough right now. We barely hold the Senate as it is, and if we lose even one competitive race this year the GOP could take control. Theres no margin for error here. Especially when my opponent is Kari Lake the MAGA Queen, Trumps biggest cheerleader, and fresh off a big fundraiser with a bunch of rich QAnon activists. We cant let her get anywhere near the Senate. At the end of the day, those are the stakes here in Arizona. And its why I need to ask you, one more time, to make that donation. If you can afford to chip in $5 or $10 that would be great. If you can only give less, thats great. If you can give more, thats great, too. Please, just make that donation. Contribute: Your support really does mean the world to me.

If she doesnt run that means the MAGA-right and the national GOP will focus all of their attention, all of their attack ads, on one person: Ruben. Back in 2022, millions of dollars were already being spent on attack ads at this point in the race. Those millions havent hit yet.

Thanks to my family and a strong support system of teachers, coaches, and the good folks at the YMCA, I earned a full-ride football scholarship to Baylor University and then went on to play in the NFL. But playing football was never my only dream from a young age I knew I wanted to help people. So I became a civil rights attorney to defend what I believe is our most fundamental right: the right to vote.

I ran for Congress in 2018 because I wanted more kids in North Texas to have the opportunity to achieve their version of the American dream.

Kirsten Gillibrand introduces a resolution to certify the Equal Rights Amendment and enshrine reproductive rights in the Constitution. Jenga, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) would establish that our civil rights cannot be infringed upon or taken away on the basis of gender. Activists have been fighting for nearly 100 years to add this amendment to our Constitution and we can't wait any longer. Since Kirsten announced this resolution, so many Democrats have already added their names to standwith her and show their support for the ERA. Now, we've set a HUGE goal to reach 50,000 signatures, and we're counting on your help to do it! Please, Jenga, it's time to raise our voices as one and DEMAND gender equity will you join us? When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, they took away the right for half of the population to access the health care they need. It's discrimination based on sex plain and simple. Adding the ERA to our Constitution would give us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights across the entire country. Right now, we're closer than ever before to certifying the ERA: 38 states have ratified it, and it's just one signature away from being added to the Constitution. But an arbitrary deadline is stopping us from finally certifying this amendment! That's why Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has introduced new legislation that would establish that this deadline should not stop us from certifying the ERA. With bipartisan support and filibuster reform, we can pass this legislation, finally establish gender equality in our Constitution and restore reproductive freedoms nationwide.

Now, as senator, she's on the front lines of the fights that matter most to families. But as the 2024 election heats up, GOP megadonors are targeting Kirsten's seat for defeat. And right now, she's falling short of her critical $50,000 mid-month goal. So I have to ask: Will you donate $5 or more before midnight to help Kirsten make up the gap and protect her must-win Senate seat? Please, Jenga, we need Kirsten's voice in the Senate especially with far-right extremists threatening the rights and progress that we've fought so hard to win. Trust me on this: Kirsten deliversresults.Over the last couple of years, she's won legislation to reform our military's criminal justice system, protect survivors of sexual harassment and assault, expand benefits for veterans and 9/11 first responders, crack down on gun trafficking, and tackle corruption in Washington. Now, she's leading the charge to win guaranteed paid family leave, certify the Equal Rights Amendment, restore reproductive rights, protect seniors, and so much more. I've had the privilege of working closely with Kirsten on these issues and so many others. I've seen her fight harder than just about anyone else to build coalitions across the aisle, block dangerous bills, and get her legislation across the finish line. And I'm not exaggerating here: While in the House, Kirsten gave birth to her second son mere hours after working a 13-hour day. Kirsten is one of a kind. And families in New York and across the nation need her voice in Washington advocating for their rights, priorities, and futures. But that's why the GOP is ready to do everything within their power to defeat her this fall. New York Republicans celebrated their best election cycle in decades in 2022. Their extremist candidates flipped enough seats in the midterms to win control of the House and came within single digits of winning the governorship. Now, they're directly targeting Kirsten's seat to retake Senate control. I know that my friend has what it takes to defeat the GOP and their megadonors. But because she refuses to accept money from corporate PACs, she's counting on strong grassroots support to win this critical race.

That's a lesson that my grandmother, Polly Noonan, first taught me decades ago. Well before most women had any political power, my grandmother organized women into a political force in Albany. By the time I was in elementary school, I was tagging along with her to all kinds of Democratic campaign headquarters, rallies and events. She remains one of my biggest role models and I carry her wisdom with me to this day. She taught me that my voice matters, that womens voices matter and that grassroots activism matters. And she showed me how campaigns are won by the people who put in the work like the volunteers knocking doors, stuffing envelopes, turning out the vote and donating what they can, when they can. For decades, first by my grandmother's side and then as a public servant myself, I've seen how those small grassroots actions all add up to victory on Election Day. That's how Democrats defeated the odds in 2022 to defend and even expand our Senate majority. And that's why I know that we can win again in 2024.

These are the terrifying stakes of this important race: Mitch and his super PAC buddies have raised BONKERS amounts of money in the past year to stop Jon by any means necessary. And if theyre successful? BOOM: national abortion ban, lower wages, your health care gutted. Jon needs your help like, yesterday. Hell, even if you already gave yesterday, he needs you to give again. And guess what?! For the next 24 hours, ALL donations will be DOUBLED to help protect the Democratic majority. Isnt that worthwhile? We need an extra push to get us across that finish line, and I know we can do it together. Rush an urgent contribution of $10 (or more if youre feeling spicy!) to help reelect Jon and support Kirsten: Jon Tester is our best chance to protect the Democratic Senate majority.

I have so much to thank you for, so this message is a bit longer than usual. But in case you're short on time, I have to make sure that you see this first: My mid-month deadline is approaching, and we're still pacing dangerously short of my $100,000 goal. I hate that I have to ask, but this is incredibly important: If you have anything extra to spare, can you chip in $5 to help me hit this goal? Weve made so much progress together already, but I need your help to make sure that we can continue this work for years to come. If you have the time to keep reading, I hope that you'll take a moment to celebrate our recent wins. In 2023, we really got to work. I introduced legislation to create a national paid leave program legislation that I first introduced 10 years ago and have continued to advocate for since then. You immediately rallied behind me, voicing your support for this long-overdue legislation. And today, support for paid family leave is higher than ever before including 85% of all voters in battleground states! Thank you for making this possible. I also released my Strategic Plan on Aging to make sure that our seniors can retire with dignity and financial stability. From expanding existing programs like Medicare to helping more seniors remain in their homes, these proposals would drastically improve the quality of life for millions of seniors. Thank you for supporting my work to make this happen. I'm also incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support from this grassroots team after I introduced a resolution to finally certify the Equal Rights Amendment. This amendment would establish protections against gender-based discrimination in our Constitution, once and for all, giving us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights. Activists have been fighting for the ERA for 100 years, and it is truly an honor to carry forward their work today. Thank you for standing beside me in the fight for gender equity and reproductive freedom. Lastly, I fought tirelessly to make sure that the National Defense Authorization Act included a pay increase for service members, investments to clean up toxic PFAS contamination and funding for hundreds of spots in my cyber security academy at over 400 schools. Thank you for helping me ensure that our veterans and service members get the benefits they deserve. There have been so many other moments when you've stood beside me, and I am grateful for every single one of them. But our fight for progress is far from over. And now, Democrats are in the most difficult election years in recent memory. Here in New York, Republicans just had their best election cycle in years. Now, they're directly targeting my seat. With a narrow 51-49 majority, we cannot afford to show any signs of weakness. Missing my mid-month goal would be sending a crystal clear message to the GOP that this seat is up for grabs. So please, will you donate $5 or whatever you can spare before 11:59 p.m. to help me continue our fight for progress in this year? Because I refuse to accept corporate PAC money, I'm counting on your help to make up the gap. Thank you again for all that you do. I'm so grateful to have you on my team as we head into March.

This is hardly a surprise. We knew Trump's nomination was all but certain months ago. But now that it's official, we have to step back and recognize exactly what's at stake here. We cannot forget who Trump is. He is one of the most extreme, out-of-touch leaders in modern history. He signed a radical tax cut for millionaires like himself, wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would raise the price of drugs and increase health care premiums and has proposed cutting Social Security and Medicare. He promised to lead the charge to enact a nationwide abortion ban. And because of Trump, more than 1 in 3 women of reproductive age already live in a state with an abortion ban in effect. He threatened our democracy and incited a deadly insurrection. Trump has and will put his interests before our Constitution, our democracy and American families every single time. He is a crook and a liar. He has spent his entire time in politics lying to American voters about everything from a deadly pandemic to election results. On top of his lies, he is facing more than 90 criminal charges. President Biden and our Democratic Senate majority have spent the last three years working day in and day out to deliver for working families. To protect our freedoms, our families and our health care. But now all of that could be at risk.

Our country can't handle six more years of Ted Cruz, his attacks on reproductive freedoms, his dismantling of our fundamental voting rights, and his endless self-centered antics. He's proven time and time again that his only loyalty is to himself, not the people he's supposed to represent. It's time to send him packing.

Earlier this week, Kyrsten Sinema declared she was NOT going to run for reelection. That means it's Ruben vs. Kari Lake. And that's why we're asking you to donate $5 to our campaign today. $5 to keep Kari Lake out of the Senate. $5 to replace Sen. Sinema with Ruben Gallego, a vote to bypass the filibuster to protect abortion access, expand voting rights, and more. $5 because Ruben Gallego can't win this race without you. We know $5 may not feel like it can win this race alone. But by the time you read this, lots and lots of people who want to keep Kari Lake out of the Senate are donating $5 to Ruben today. Now they're hoping you'll do the same. Can Ruben Gallego and everyone who has donated to support him count on you to split a $5 contribution between Ruben and Kirsten Gillibrand to help Ruben hold this seat and to keep Kari Lake out of the Senate?

So when you hear people say that 2024 will be the most consequential election of our lifetimes, thats not hyperbole. We need to do everything we can right now to ensure that we reelect President Biden and save our Democratic Senate majority. That means getting the message out about the ways in which President Biden and Senate Democrats have delivered for the American people: * Capping the price of insulin and lowering prescription drug costs for seniors; * Finally enacting a gun trafficking ban and passing transformative gun safety legislation; * Protecting Social Security; * And investing billions to rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels and sewer systems creating good-paying, union jobs at the same time. Make no mistake: Democrats have a winning message.But we have to make sure that our message of results and progress can cut through the noise of far-right lies and attacks up and down the ballot.So I'm personally asking you to split a donation of $5, or whatever you can spare today, between President Biden's reelection campaign and mine.

I am so grateful to my fellow Texas voters and grassroots supporters like you for entrusting me with this honor I will not let you down. I'm ready to outwork Ted Cruz to win this thing because the stakes of this election are too high not to. From voting rights to abortion, our freedoms are under attack. Everyday costs are still too high. Simply put: Texans cannot afford six more years of Ted Cruz. Thats why this campaign is so important. Two recent polls showed us tied with Cruz, and I know we can win this race but I need you with me to do it. So I have to ask, Jenga: Will you donate $5 or $25 right now to help me and Kirsten Gillibrandkeep up tonight's momentum all the way through Election Day? Every dollar helps as we work to build the massive grassroots movement it'll take to fire Ted Cruz. The real race begins right now, Jenga, and it's going to be a tough fight. But don't worry I've been an underdog my whole life. I know what it takes to beat the odds and win a tough fight. I'm a 4th generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas by a single mom who sometimes worked two jobs to make ends meet. I never knew my dad but thanks to my community of teachers, coaches and counselors at the YMCA, who helped my mom, aunt and uncle raise me, I had the opportunity to chase my version of the American Dream. Without them, I never would've made it to the NFL, gone to law school, become a civil rights lawyer, served in the Obama Administration, or run against a 22-year GOP incumbent and won, becoming the first Democrat to ever represent TX-32 in Congress. And thanks to them, I am where I am today: the official Democratic nominee who has the chance to become Texas first Black Senator. The chance to finally defeat Ted Cruz and give Texans the committed leadership we deserve. With experts calling Ted Cruz the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country and two polls showing us TIED, the only thing that could hold us back is resources. Its true that everything is bigger in Texas, and this campaign is no exception. Its going to take the biggest grassroots movement Texas has ever seen to beat Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz already has more than $6.5 million in the bank to attack me with, so please: Will you chip in $5, $25, or any amount to me and Kirsten Gillibrandbefore midnight tonight to make sure I have the resources to fight back against Ted Cruz's attacks, reach voters across Texas, and win? Your support would mean so much as we work to give Texans the leadership we need and deserve. Thank you so much for being a part of this team. Let's do this. Colin P.S.

This is hardly a surprise. We knew Trump's nomination was all but certain months ago. But now that it's official, we have to step back and recognize exactly what's at stake here. We cannot forget who Trump is. He is one of the most extreme, out-of-touch leaders in modern history. He signed a radical tax cut for millionaires like himself, wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would raise the price of drugs and increase health care premiums and has proposed cutting Social Security and Medicare. He promised to lead the charge to enact a nationwide abortion ban. And because of Trump, more than 1 in 3 women of reproductive age already live in a state with an abortion ban in effect. He threatened our democracy and incited a deadly insurrection. Trump has and will put his interests before our Constitution, our democracy and American families every single time. He is a crook and a liar. He has spent his entire time in politics lying to American voters about everything from a deadly pandemic to election results. On top of his lies, he is facing more than 90 criminal charges. President Biden and our Democratic Senate majority have spent the last three years working day in and day out to deliver for working families. To protect our freedoms, our families and our health care. But now all of that could be at risk.

Weve made so much progress together already, but I need your help to make sure that we can continue this work for years to come. If you have the time to keep reading, I hope that you'll take a moment to celebrate our recent wins. In 2023, we really got to work. I introduced legislation to create a national paid leave program legislation that I first introduced 10 years ago and have continued to advocate for since then. You immediately rallied behind me, voicing your support for this long-overdue legislation. And today, support for paid family leave is higher than ever before including 85% of all voters in battleground states! Thank you for making this possible. I also released my Strategic Plan on Aging to make sure that our seniors can retire with dignity and financial stability. From expanding existing programs like Medicare to helping more seniors remain in their homes, these proposals would drastically improve the quality of life for millions of seniors. Thank you for supporting my work to make this happen. I'm also incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support from this grassroots team after I introduced a resolution to finally certify the Equal Rights Amendment. This amendment would establish protections against gender-based discrimination in our constitution, once and for all, giving us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights. Activists have been fighting for the ERA for 100 years, and it is truly an honor to carry forward their work today. Thank you for standing beside me in the fight for gender equity and reproductive freedom. Lastly, I fought tirelessly to make sure that the National Defense Authorization Act included a pay increase for service members, investments to clean up toxic PFAS contamination and funding for hundreds of spots in my brand-new cyber security academy at over 400 schools. Thank you for helping me ensure that our veterans and service members get the benefits they deserve. There have been so many other moments when you've stood beside me, and I am grateful for every single one of them. But our fight for progress is far from over. And now, Democrats are in the most difficult election year in recent memory. Here in New York, Republicans just had their best election cycle in years. Now, they're directly targeting my seat. With a narrow 51-49 majority, we cannot afford to show any signs of weakness. Missing this end-of-month goal would be sending a crystal clear message to the GOP that this seat is up for grabs. So please, will you donate $5 or whatever you can spare before 11:59 p.m. to help me continue our fight for progress this year?

I'm reaching out to ask you to help my friend Kirsten Gillibrand. Will you give me a moment to explain? I'm incredibly proud to call Kirsten my friend,colleague, and fellow New York senator. From her very first day serving in Congress back in 2007, she's been one of Washington's strongest voices for progress. Now, as senator, she's on the front lines of the fights that matter most to families. But as the 2024 election heats up, GOP megadonors are targeting Kirsten's seat for defeat. And right now, she's falling short of her critical $50,000 end-of-month goal. So I have to ask: Will you donate $5 or more before midnight to help Kirsten make up the gap and protect her must-win Senate seat? Please, Jenga, we need Kirsten's voice in the Senate especially with far-right extremists threatening the rights and progress that we've fought so hard to win. Trust me on this: Kirsten deliversresults.Over the last couple of years, she's won legislation to reform our military's criminal justice system, protect survivors of sexual harassment and assault, expand benefits for veterans and 9/11 first responders, crack down on gun trafficking, and tackle corruption in Washington. Now, she's leading the charge to win guaranteed paid family leave, certify the Equal Rights Amendment, restore reproductive rights, protect seniors, and so much more. I've had the privilege of working closely with Kirsten on these issues and so many others. I've seen her fight harder than just about anyone else to build coalitions across the aisle, block dangerous bills, and get her legislation across the finish line. And I'm not exaggerating here: While in the House, Kirsten gave birth to her second son mere hours after working a 13-hour day. Kirsten is one of a kind. And families in New York and across the nation need her voice in Washington advocating for their rights, priorities, and futures. But that's why the GOP is ready to do everything within their power to defeat her this fall. New York Republicans celebrated their best election cycle in decades in 2022. Their extremist candidates flipped enough seats in the midterms to win control of the House and came within single digits of winning the governorship. Now, they're directly targeting Kirsten's seat to retake Senate control. I know that my friend has what it takes to defeat the GOP and their megadonors. But because she refuses to accept money from corporate PACs, she's counting on strong grassroots support to win this critical race. So please, before her end-of-month deadline, will you rush a donation to help Kirsten defend her seat and continue to fight for progress for families in the Senate? Thank you for taking the time to support my friend and help defend our Senate majority. With gratitude, Chuck Schumer - This email was sent to Jengabuilding90@gmail.com.

The decision totally ignores our understanding of science. And it flies in the face of our basic rights to privacy. This is EXACTLY what we feared would happen when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

I have so much to thank you for, so this message is a bit longer than usual. But in case you're short on time, I have to make sure that you see this first: My end-of-month deadline is less than 36 hours away, and we're still pacing dangerously short of my $100,000 goal. I hate that I have to ask, but this is incredibly important: If you have anything extra to spare, can you chip in $5 to help me hit this goal? Weve made so much progress together already, but I need your help to make sure that we can continue this work for years to come. If you have the time to keep reading, I hope that you'll take a moment to celebrate our recent wins. In 2023, we really got to work. I introduced legislation to create a national paid leave program legislation that I first introduced 10 years ago, and have continued to advocate for since then. You immediately rallied behind me, voicing your support for this long-overdue legislation. And today, support for paid family leave is higher than ever before including 85% of all voters in battleground states! Thank you for making this possible. I also released my Strategic Plan on Aging to make sure that our seniors can retire with dignity and financial stability. From expanding existing programs like Medicare to helping more seniors remain in their homes, these proposals would drastically improve the quality of life for millions of seniors. Thank you for supporting my work to make this happen. I'm also incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support from this grassroots team after I introduced a resolution to finally certify the Equal Rights Amendment. This amendment would establish protections against gender-based discrimination in our constitution, once and for all, giving us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights. Activists have been fighting for the ERA for 100 years, and it is truly an honor to carry forward their work today. Thank you for standing beside me in the fight for gender equity and reproductive freedom. Lastly, I fought tirelessly to make sure that the National Defense Authorization Act included a pay increase for service members, investments to clean up toxic PFAS contamination and funding for hundreds of spots in my brand-new cyber security academy at over 400 schools. Thank you for helping me ensure that our veterans and service members get the benefits they deserve. There have been so many other moments when you've stood beside me, and I am grateful for every single one of them. But our fight for progress is far from over. And now, Democrats are heading into one of the most difficult election years in recent memory. Here in New York, Republicans just had their best election cycle in years. Now, they're directly targeting my seat. With a narrow 51-49 majority, we cannot afford to show any signs of weakness. Missing this end-of-month goal would be sending a crystal clear message to the GOP that this seat is up for grabs. So please, will you donate $5 or whatever you can spare before 11:59 p.m. to help me continue our fight for progress in this year? Because I refuse to accept corporate PAC money, I'm counting on your help to make up the gap. Thank you again for all that you do. I'm so grateful to have you on my team as we head into March.

She remains one of my biggest role models and I carry her wisdom with me to this day. She taught me that my voice matters, that womens voices matter and that grassroots activism matters.

Kirsten is working tirelessly to win progress on the issues that matter most to families. She's fighting to pass guaranteed paid family leave, certify the Equal Rights Amendment, regulate dangerous ghost guns and defend Social Security and Medicare. Kirsten is one of our strongest advocates for progress but New York Republicans are working overtime to DEFEAT her. They just had their best election cycle in decades. If we lose in New York, our Senate majority will be all but DOOMED. But Kirsten refuses to accept a single cent from corporate PACs.

Our country is in the midst of a full-blown gun violence epidemic. And we all know that it won't end until leaders in Washington finally stand up to the gun lobby and pass an assault weapons ban. Kirsten is working hard to win the votes that we need to finally get these weapons of war off our streets. But she's counting on people like you to continue raising your voices for change until we get the job done. That's why I'm asking you to add your name to this petition to help us reach our new 5,000 signature goal before our midnight deadline. Please, will you sign on now to show your support for an assault weapons ban? Your signature would mean so much to Kirsten. Thank you so much, Emily Graham Kirsten's Digital Director - Forwarded message - From: Team Gillibrand Subject: add your name to ban assault weapons Jenga, 11 years ago, a gunman armed with an assault weapon killed 20 children and six faculty members at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Sandy Hook shooting was a moment of national reckoning. Americans knew then that something must be done to stop horrific shootings like this one from ever happening again. But in the 11 years since then, the gun lobby has worked overtime to block the commonsense reforms that would have stopped future mass shootings. Sandy Hook, Orlando, Parkland, Uvalde, Buffalo the list of communities devastated by assault weapons goes on and on. And it's long past time for Washington to finally listen to the majority of voters and BAN these weapons. Leaders like Kirsten Gillibrand are working tirelessly to protect communities from gun violence, but we all have the power to use our voice for change. That's why we're asking 5,000 people to sign our petition to support an assault weapons ban before midnight tonight. Please, will you add your name now to keep these weapons of war away from schools, off our streets and out of our communities? Today, it feels as though we're stuck in an endless cycle of gun violence. Even as we mourn the most recent shootings it's impossible to shake the feeling that the next mass killing is inevitable. But this cycle isn't endless. The next mass killing isn't inevitable. There are concrete, straightforward steps that we can take right nowto end the cycle and protect our communities from gun violence. And the vast majority of Americans support these kinds of commonsense reforms. In 2022, we took a meaningful step forward by passing a package of gun safety reforms including Kirsten's legislation to end gun trafficking. But there is so much more that we must still do. That starts with getting assault weapons off our streets. Kirsten won't stop fighting until we pass this legislation and end this epidemic, but she needs grassroots Americans like you to stand with her. So please, if you believe that we can win a future where communities are free from gun violence, will you add your name to support an assault weapons ban before midnight tonight?

Help us fight back now. Please split a donation between Kirsten Gillibrand and Tammy Baldwin to ensure our campaign has the resources to fight off the GOPs self-funding recruit, defend Wisconsins Senate seat, and protect our Democratic majority. After Republicans spent an eye-popping $77 million to buy their way to victory in Wisconsins last Senate race, Mitch McConnells sure that if they spend big, they can flip Tammys seat this time around. Thats why he called megamillionaire Eric Hovde back from his $7 million ocean view mansion in California to self-fund a run for U.S. Senate in Wisconsin. Its only a matter of time before our new opponent and national Republicans go up on the airwaves attacking Tammy. Wisconsinites will see right through Hovde, but only if we can break through the noise and make sure folks know who he really is: an out-of-touch megamillionaire whod rubber stamp McConnells far-right agenda in the U.S. Senate.

This race is our best and possibly our ONLY chance of saving the Senate majority and beating one of the worst politicians in America. I've spent half a century fighting to elect Democrats. So trust me when I say this: All signs are pointing to a huge upset in Florida. Scott only won his seat by 0.12%, and his approval ratings are tanking. It's no wonder why election experts rank him as one of the most vulnerable senators in the country people hate his policies. Debbie is a strong candidate, but in a race like this, cash is king and Scott has already dumped over $3 million into attack ads. This is a make-or-break moment, Jenga. Can I count on you to split a donation between Debbie and Kirsten right now so that Debbie can flip Florida blue and save our Senate majority?

When I was 14, my family came to America to seek a better life. We arrived here with big dreams for the future. But those early days were hard. I remember my mom working back-to-back double shifts and still struggling to afford rent for our small, one room apartment. So, after I turned 15, I got a job working the early morning shift at a local doughnut shop. It was just a minimum wage job, but the small checks I brought home gave my family room to breathe. Finally, after a lot of hard work, the possibilities that we could only dream of before became reality. We were able to move out of that one room apartment, and I got a scholarship to an incredible college. Eventually, I found a career path where I could give back to the communities and country that gave me so much. That call to service took me to places I had never even dreamed of before. I became the first South American immigrant to serve in Congress, and now, I'm running for the United States Senate.

But that's why the GOP is ready to do everything within their power to defeat her this fall. New York Republicans celebrated their best election cycle in decades in 2022.

But Democrats are facing a tough election this November.Trump is all but certain to become the GOP nominee, and polls show that the race for the White House is neck-and-neck.And with a razor-thin fight for control of the Senate, we truly have zero room for error.

So I'm personally asking you to split a donation of $5, or whatever you can spare today, between President Biden's reelection campaign and mine. Please, will you donate now to help us defend the White House and the Senate this November? I know how hard you've fought these past few years to send President Biden to the White House and defend our Senate majority. I am so grateful for all that you have done.

We became fast friends, and our families grew close as she and Gabby learned the ropes in Washington together.

Today, I'm incredibly proud to count Kirsten as both a friend and one of my closest colleagues here in the Senate.

The fact of the matter is that 2024 is going to be an incredibly hard year for Democrats. We'll need an iron-tight defense if we want to protect our majority and keep Mitch McConnell out of power. And truthfully, what we're seeing in New York is concerning: In 2022, Republicans had their best election cycle in decades. Now, their megadonors are directly targeting Kirsten and they've got endless resources to do it. Listen, I know firsthand exactly the lengths Mitch McConnell and his allies are willing to go to unseat a Democrat. But I also know what it takes to stop them. And it all starts with people like you stepping up and investing in bold leaders like Kirsten.

Please, will you add your name before 11:59 p.m. tonight to show your support for background checks? We're counting on 10,000 activists to add their names! Jenga, America is in the midst of a gun violence epidemic. There have already been more than 30 mass shootings in 2024 alone. Our children and communities are living in fear of gun assailants and violence every day. But it doesn't have to be this way. There are simple gun safety reforms that we knowwillcurb gun violence and make our communities safer. The vast majority of Americans support basic reforms like expanded background checks. Gun safety legislation shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's about protecting communities and preventing senseless deaths. But the far-right gun lobby is spending MILLIONS each year to stop commonsense legislation from becoming the law of the land. And each year, the cycle of mass shootings and violence continues. That's why Democrats are fighting to finally make a change and pass universal background checks! This would be a major step forward to a safer future and we're counting on grassroots activists like you to join these Democratic leaders in standing up to the gun lobby.

Well before most women had any political power, my grandmother organized women into a political force in Albany. By the time I was in elementary school, I was tagging along with her to all kinds of Democratic campaign headquarters, rallies and events. She remains one of my biggest role models and I carry her wisdom with me to this day. She taught me that my voice matters, that womens voices matter and that grassroots activism matters. And she showed me how campaigns are won by the people who put in the work like the volunteers knocking doors, stuffing envelopes, turning out the vote and donating what they can, when they can. For decades, first by my grandmother's side and then as a public servant myself, I've seen how those small grassroots actions all add up to victory on Election Day. That's how Democrats defeated the odds in 2022 to defend and even expand our Senate majority. And that's why I know that we can win again in 2024. With Democrats defending 23 seats, the odds are certainly stacked against us. And after the 2022 red wave in New York, Republicans here are already targeting my seat for defeat. But when people like you get off the sidelines and chip in even just $3, eventually we'll build a grassroots movement capable of defeating even the GOP's wealthiest megadonors. So please, will you chip in $3 or $25 or whatever you can spare today to help save our Senate majority by building a grassroots movement one grassroots gift at a time? I refuse to accept money from corporate PACs, so these grassroots donations are truly critical to my campaign.

When I was 14, my family came to America to seek a better life. We arrived here with big dreams for the future. But those early days were hard. I remember my mom working back-to-back double shifts and still struggling to afford rent for our small, one room apartment. So, after I turned 15, I got a job working the early morning shift at a local doughnut shop. It was just a minimum wage job, but the small checks I brought home gave my family room to breathe. Finally, after a lot of hard work, the possibilities that we could only dream of before became reality. We were able to move out of that one room apartment, and I got a scholarship to an incredible college. Eventually, I found a career path where I could give back to the communities and country that gave me so much. That call to service took me to places I had never even dreamed of before. I became the first South American immigrant to serve in Congress, and now, I'm running for the United States Senate. Making doughnuts in the morning before homeroom brought me all the way to Congress. I've seen time and time again how small acts have the power to create big, transformative change.

Your insights will be critical to building a winning reelection strategy and defending the Senate for Democrats. When it comes to getting things done for you and your family, I've never backed down from a tough fight, and I never will. The challenges our country is facing are too urgent and the stakes are simply too high to sit on the sidelines. There is still so much left to do to address the climate crisis, establish national paid leave, expand access to affordable health care, bolster voting rights and defend reproductive freedom. But I can't continue these fights without your help: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that the GOP has a clear path to retaking the Senate majority, and its already targeting my seat after winning races across New York last November. That's why it's so important that I hear from you today. Please, will you take our brief priorities survey to share your thoughts with me directly? Thank you. I'm so grateful to have you on our team.

Gillibrand for Senate c/o Verdolino & Lowey 124 Washington St. Suite 101 Foxboro, MA 02035 United States\",\n  'Jenga,I like to say I come from a long line of strong, fearless women who didnt know the meaning of the word impossible. My grandmother, Polly, was a force of nature. She organized women into a political force in Albany well before most women had any political power. My mother was one of just three women in her law school class and a black belt in karate. I remember her baking cookies with my friends and me, all the while emptying the dishwasher and talking on the phone to file the details of an adoption case she was working on. When I first ran for Congress back in 2006, my mom was one of the only people who thought I could win. I was told that my purple, upstate New York district had more cows than Democrats. But I believed then as I do now that the toughest fights arealwaysworth taking on. We won that race, and its been the honor of my life to serve New York ever since. Ive always said: Government only works when people raise their voices and demand change. Its a pretty simple premise, really. But with Washington so overrun by corporate lobbyists and special interests who trade money for access, it doesnt happen enough. But together, I believe that we can effect real, meaningful change in Washington.I believe we can protect and restore reproductive rights nationwide. I believe we can ensure thateveryAmerican has quality, affordable health care. I believe we can fight global climate change, make paid family and medical leave a reality for all Americans, enact meaningful gun safety laws and build a more just and equitable economy. With so much at stake,Jenga,I needyourhelp.Democrats are hanging on to our Senate majority by a thread. Mitch McConnell only needs to flip two seats to retake control. And becauseI refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, I cant fight back against the GOPs megadonor machine, keep this seat blue and defend our narrow majority without your grassroots support. So please, will you donate $5 or more right now to help me defeat the GOP in New York, defend the Senate for Democrats and continue fearlessly fighting for you in Washington?

I couldn't be more honored to represent the people of Ohio and have the opportunity to keep fighting for the Dignity of Work in the Senate. I want to personally thank every member of this team including you, friend for powering our grassroots movement this far. All we have accomplished together so far makes it clearer than ever, Ohio voters want someone who will fight for them in the Senate. Better wages and working conditions, reproductive freedom, affordable housing and health care I promise to keep up these critical fights for all of us. But our real fight starts now, friend. We now have an official opponent, Bernie Moreno, and he's a deep-pocketed Donald Trump ally that's ready to spend millions of dollars to try to buy this seat. Polls show this race is neck and neck, Republicans are already spending record-breaking sums to defeat me and flip the Senate red, and it's only going to get worse. So I'm personally asking: Will you split $5 or more right now between my campaign and Brady PACs to make sure we have the resources to fight back against GOP attacks, protect this seat, and keep the Senate blue? You're the reason we have made it this far and you're the reason why we'll do it again in November. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

There were more mass killings in 2023 than in any year since 2006. On average, more than 100 Americans are killed by guns every single day. So many of our communities have become massacre sites: Lewiston, Perry, Buffalo, Uvalde, Nashville, the list goes on and on. Gun violence is terrorizing our communities, traumatizing our children and taking too many innocent lives. Congress has the power to stop it but the gun lobby is STILL blocking the lifesaving reforms that would end the violence.

If you do one thing today, can it be splitting a contribution between Brady PAC and my friend Josh Rileys campaign for Congress in NY-19? Joshs race is one of the most competitive in the entire country, and national Democrats just named it one of the top flip opportunities we need to win to take back the House. Its also a great opportunity to beat up on a truly insufferable Republican, which you know is almost as important. A few months ago Marc Molinaro (Joshs opponent) told a bunch of reporters how stupid he thinks everyone he represents is. He said they wouldnt know what was going on in Washington if he backed over them with a pickup truck. Give me a break. Id rather get backed over by a pickup truck myself than see that jerk go back to Congress. (Figuratively, I mean.

I grew up on my familys farm, and Sharla and I still work that land today. In my opinion, being a farmer makes me a better senator. My background is a big part of the reason I remain grounded and focused on defending our Montana way of life. Because with all the chaos in Washington (especially now), you need somebody who will roll up their sleeves and get to work. Last time I ran, nearly $70 million was spent on the Montana Senate race. This time around, weve already passed that number: an eye-popping $120 million has been spent or reserved in advertising alone. Itll take a lot of support from this team to raise what well need to protect this seat. And if you know me, Im not the kind of person who likes to ask for money. But I bet Mitch McConnell would be furious if we showed him that a whole lot of grassroots power is stronger than his wealthy donors and super PACs will ever be. Lets be clear: This election isnt a sure thing. Experts say this race is a toss-up and rank Montana as one of the seats most likely to flip. Thats why its SO important you make a contribution todayeverything is on the line. Everyoneincluding Mitch McConnellis watching what we raise to judge the strength of this team. I dont expect you to chip in every time I ask, but I need you on my side now more than ever to show our opponents were ready to fight back and win.

Accountability was always distant, and they still got enough buy-in from the brainwashed population to keep telling lies. However, the American people are waking up. The media is starting to get caught up in their web of lies. Public trust in the media has tanked as Americans have started to wake up to the realities that face our country. If theres one thing Ive learned Its that the fake news is not salvageable. We cant wait for them to change because they wont. What we can do is leave them in the dust, and thats exactly what Americans are doing. I am in desperate need of your help. We cant stop this fight now.

First: Following Kyrsten Sinemas departure from the race, Left-wing donors and activist groups donatedover $1 million to Gallegos campaign in just 24 hours. Then: That million dollar windfall found its way directly into a MASSIVE TV ad buy to try to trick voters into thinking hes some sort of moderate - a claim that couldnt be further from the truth. Next: Gallegos dark money liberal allies, backed by George Soros and Chuck Schumer, announced they are reserving $23 million in TV air time to spread lies and smears against me and the entire MAGA movement. Now: My team is preparing a response - but we need your help to secure the funds necessary to make a major advertising blitz.

A new poll shows just 24% of Nebraskan voters approve of Republican Deb Fischer and in that same poll, I am LEADING by 2 points! Seriously. Nebraskans are fed up with Washington. Both parties Democrats and Republicans are full of too many people that have been bought and paid for by corporations and billionaires. The Republicans dont look out for blue-collar working people like me, and too many Democrats in DC dont seem to understand rural America anymore. Im not rich, and I dont come from some political dynasty. Ive got no business running for the U.S. Senate and thats exactly why I am. I am a proud card-carrying steamfitter and mechanic. I was president of my local union before I got fired for leading a strike that saved 500 middle-class jobs in Nebraska. I served in the United States Navy and joined the National Guard to help pay for college before I had to drop out so I could keep food on the table for my family. Theres nobody like me in the Senate. But with your help, I believe we can win and finally elect a senator whose collars are blue. And this new poll showing me in the lead proves it. I dont have corporate PACs writing me hundreds of thousands of dollars in checks like my opponent does. If Im going to defeat Republican Deb Fischer and win this Senate race, I am counting on grassroots donors like you to believe in me and make a donation right now to my campaign: Please, will you chip in just $5 to my campaign for U.S. Senate or whatever amount you can afford to become a Founding Donor and help me defeat Republican Senator Deb Fischer this November?

I had dropped out of college and gone to work for the company after my wife got pregnant. Lifes easy when all you gotta do is take care of yourself but we had diapers to buy and needed health insurance for our growing family. When I applied in 2004, there were 6 positions and 600 applications. Working at Kelloggs promised to be a lifelong career. A good-paying job that afforded me the opportunity to become a homeowner, let my wife stay home with the kids, live decently, retire some day, and hopefully live happily ever after. But over the years, wages became a two-tier system. New workers were being paid less than employees had made decades earlier. Cost of living adjustments werent keeping up anywhere near inflation. Retirement and health insurance plans had been gutted. It just wasnt right. They were making record profits and doing it off the backs of workers. So in October 2021, we walked out. And as president of our local union, I led the strike. [ was the first time many of us had ever walked a picket line. It was cold, but we were determined to hold our lines even through the dead of the winter if we had to. Every worker knew we were a part of something bigger than ourselves. We were in a fight for the future of the American middle class. After 11 weeks, and the company threatening to permanently replace every union worker, we reached an agreement. More importantly, we saved 500 good-paying jobs here in Nebraska alone. It was one of the proudest moments of my life. [ the strike, I was fired. The company has its version of events for why, but I believe it was because I was union president. Someone had to pay and my head was on the chopping block. Its easy to let yourself get beaten down by life. To let big corporations and the politicians they own in Washington make all the decisions and just accept that thats how things will always be. But thats not me. Instead, Ive decided to run against one of the most corporate politicians U.S. Senator Republican Deb Fischer and with your help, we are going to defeat her. A new poll shows just 24% of Nebraskan voters approve of Deb Fischer, and in that same poll, I am LEADING her by 2 points.

And can that leader find the money to put that message out farther west, beyond the urban centers of Omaha and Lincoln? A problem for Mr. Osborn, is money. Signature drives are costly, and 90 of Nebraskas 93 counties are rural, adding to the challenge. Mr. Osborn himself has little name recognition statewide, and would require an introduction in the form of television ads and a robust campaign schedule, both expensive endeavors.

When we hit send on that first email, we hoped people would understand and have Chris back.and you did! The contributions started rolling in. The response was humbling. Immediately, Amy, a nurse from Norwalk, pitched in $10. Then an educator from Hartford named Sharon made a $25 recurring contribution, and moments later, Jack, a retiree in Bridgeport, gave $50. Just like that we were off. And the truth is we wish what we had already raised would be enough to hold this seat and our senate majority. Itd be great if we never had to ask you again. But even in Connecticut, Senate races are just outrageously expensive. We know folks cant give every time we ask, and we wouldnt expect it. But if youve been waiting for the right moment to make a donation to Chris Murphys campaign, today would make a big difference ahead of our first FEC deadline of 2024.

Moreno is also writing his campaign million-dollar checks, and now that he's through the primary, the GOP will be funneling even more money into this race.

With the Senate majority hinging on PA, if we dont have the resources to fight back, it could be the difference between a red and blue Senate. Thats why were urgently reaching out. This could be the most expensive Senate race in the country, so will you split a donation between Bobs campaign and Chris Murphys re-election right now to keep the Senate blue? CONTRIBUTE: Everything is on the line in this race for the Senate majority, and we cannot afford to sit back and let these attacks go unanswered. Unlike McCormick, who is self-funding his campaign, we rely on grassroots supporters like you chipping in $5 or $10 when you can. Theres no time to waste. Can you split any amount between Bob Casey and Chris Murphy to help us fight back and hold the Democratic Senate majority? Whatever you can give today will help us compete with the GOPs millions.

Democrats cannot get complacent or lose sight of whats at stake right now. After our losses in blue states in 2022, Republicans are getting ambitious with their targets. Their goal is to win back their 2017 trifecta so they can pass more corporate tax cuts, pack the courts, and ban abortion nationwide. Support from people like you is the only chance we have to fight back. Please consider what the U.S. Senate would be like without Chris or under Republican control. It would be a disaster for our progressive movement. But if everyone is pitching in whatever you can spare when you can afford it, then we will have the resources necessary to win. We need everyone who cares to do something about it. If the gun lobby and Republican super PACs see us falter, they'll come for Chris. Thats why we need you before our numbers go public. Its so important that we not that we do not fall short at our first FEC deadline of 2024. We are short of our ambitious goal. Can you please consider pitching in whatever you can afford?

Heres why: One of the starkest contrasts for Chris Murphys re-election is that we dont fund our campaign the way Washington insiders typically tell candidates to do it especially Republicans. A lot of politicians follow a big-money strategy. They think its easier exchanging access and influence for big money corporations and PACs that fund their campaigns and super PACs. It brings in millions of dollars for them. Thats not Chris. He understands that real change comes from the bottom up. The power is with the people, and the way to make real and lasting change is when we all do our part. Thats why weve built a true grassroots-funded campaign. The challenge here is it does make our job harder at times. Like today. The truth is our average contribution has fallen considerably this quarter. Its more than a third less than what it was last year. The timing is bad when our first FEC deadline of an election year is just a couple weeks away. So we have two choices for how to solve this: We need more individual donations, or We need people to give just a tiny bit more than normal. Usually we ask people making their first online donation to donate $3. But now that you understand the challenge were facing, were asking if you can do a bit more. Can you contribute $10 to Chris Murphys re-election today? It would go a long way toward helping us compete with the millions that Republicans and dark money groups are raising to undo our progress. CONTRIBUTE: Look, it may seem like a significant challenge to overcome, but theyre no match for what our movement can do together. Thank you for pitching in. Every donation means Chris can spend more time focused on the important work, not worry about fundraising. - Team Murphy CONTRIBUTE: You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:',\n  \"[1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy Only in America do little kids go to school, worrying that they might be shot that day. Nowhere else do parents have to talk to their kids, as I have had to do, about why they got locked into a bathroom and told to be quiet for five minutes to practice what to do if a bad man enters the building. This isn't inevitable. Nowhere else does this horror happen except here in the United States of America. Mass shootings are a uniquely American problem because too many of my colleagues are afraid to act. So I need your help to keep the pressure on and show that theres more to fear from us than the NRA.

Theres no way we can hold the Senate majority without Ruben. -Team Murphy One donation.

So this request is important: Arizona is going to be one of the most contested and expensive Senate races in the country. What happens here will determine who controls the Senate, and probably the White House, too. Republicans know this as well, so the attack ads are coming. And Ruben can't fight back without your help.

I am so grateful to my fellow Texas voters and grassroots supporters like you for entrusting me with this honor I will not let you down. I'm ready to outwork Ted Cruz to win this thing because the stakes of this election are too high not to. From voting rights to abortion, our freedoms are under attack. Everyday costs are still too high. Simply put: Texans cannot afford six more years of Ted Cruz. Thats why this campaign is so important. Two recent polls showed us tied with Cruz, and I know we can win this race but I need you with me to do it.

I never knew my dad but thanks to my community of teachers, coaches and counselors at the YMCA, who helped my mom, aunt and uncle raise me, I had the opportunity to chase my version of the American Dream. Without them, I never would've made it to the NFL, gone to law school, become a civil rights lawyer, served in the Obama Administration, or run against a 22-year GOP incumbent and won, becoming the first Democrat to ever represent TX-32 in Congress. And thanks to them, I am where I am today: the official Democratic nominee who has the chance to become Texas first Black Senator. The chance to finally defeat Ted Cruz and give Texans the committed leadership we deserve. With experts calling Ted Cruz the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country and two polls showing us TIED, the only thing that could hold us back is resources. Its true that everything is bigger in Texas, and this campaign is no exception. Its going to take the biggest grassroots movement Texas has ever seen to beat Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz already has more than $6.5 million in the bank to attack me with, so please: Will you chip in any amount to me and Chris Murphy right now to make sure I have the resources to fight back against Ted Cruz's attacks, reach voters across Texas, and win?

After we defeated them in 2022, theyve become even more aggressive in their efforts to weaken gun safety legislation at the state level. Just look at whats happening in Florida. This month marked the sixth anniversary of the Parkland shooting. After that tragedy, Florida passed a law that included provisions to raise the legal age for purchasing assault weapons to 21 and to lengthen the time allowed for background checks if necessary. But right now, Republicans in the Florida House are trying to roll back both of these laws at the behest of the gun lobby. This is what theyre doing in states across the country. Our only chance to keep people in every community safe is with comprehensive action at the federal level. That means we need to win big in November to grow our movements political power in Congress.

But first, we want to give you an explanation for why your support especially today is so important. We got two major updates out of Wisconsin last week that will have significant impact on Novembers election First, on Monday, Governor Tony Evers signed new legislative maps into law to undo Republicans extreme gerrymander. Republicans have abused their power since they took control of the state legislature since 2011, and for the first time in over a decade, Wisconsin will have fair maps that give Democrats a fighting chance to take back the majority. Then the very next day, Tammy Baldwin got a new self-funding opponent: Eric Hovde. Hes an ultra-wealthy California bank owner, who has pledged to spend at least $20 million of his own money to buy this seat. Hovde was Mitch McConnells top recruit for Wisconsin because they know hell spend whatever it takes to win and fall right in line with Republicans to ban abortion, hand out tax cuts to billionaires and corporations, slash social security and more. Tammy urgently needs our support, so thats why were asking: Can you split a donation between Tammy Baldwin and Chris Murphy to make sure we hold our Senate majority? Its important that we have a big response to this news by putting resources into Wisconsin. DONATE: Making sure Tammy Baldwin has the resources to run a strong campaign isnt just good for our Senate majority it will also give her the resources to run a strong turnout operation to re-elect Joe Biden and flip the state legislature. Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature were a huge part of the efforts to overturn the 2020 election on January 6. What happens in Wisconsin is going to impact all of us and the future of democracy. Wisconsin is going to be one of the most important states in November. So we need to make sure we do everything we can to ensure Democrats win up and down the ballot here. Please split a donation between Tammy Baldwins campaign and Chris Murphys re-election.

This is unconscionable and dangerous. Its a direct message to Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump is telling Russia that if you invade Europe, the United States will not come to our allies defense if he is president. And its not just a green light to Russia. This is also a green light to China to invade Taiwan. Its effectively an invitation for World War III. Its yet another instance of Trump siding with authoritarians over our democratic allies. The only time the NATO treaty has been invoked was in defense of the United States after 9/11. When our nation was attacked, our NATO allies answered our call to help defend us. The treaty works both ways. But these attacks shouldnt come as a surprise. As president, Donald Trump carried out a systematic campaign to weaken NATO. He has long risked taking down the entire post-World War II order, and if he returns to the White House, it could easily happen. Now, Donald Trumps advisers are trying to downplay and spin his comments claiming its being blown out of proportion. They say they dont take him literally. Its bs. All this proves is that they know Trumps international agenda is as dangerous and reckless as we do. But if Trump returns to the Oval Office, he is going to fill his administration with sycophants who will fall in line with whatever he demands. The entire world heard exactly what Donald Trump said. He is a danger to global stability, and its our job to do all we can to stop him in November.

Im often at the center of Congresss work on national security, and as part of my role as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I travel overseas to represent the United States abroad. And so to try to make that work easier to understand, I almost always write a behind-the-scenes narrative of my trip for my constituents to read. Right now, Im just back from a weeklong trip to Munich, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Chiinu, Moldova; and both Ankara and Istanbul in Turkey. Five cities in six days. What follows is a candid account of the reasons for and results of the trip. Friday and Saturday: The Munich Security Conference The Munich Security Conference is the most important and well-attended transatlantic national security dialogue in the world. For three days every February, hundreds of foreign leaders gather to set the global security agenda for the coming year. Diplomatic breakthroughs are often achieved in Munich. Alliances are nurtured. Messages to adversaries are sent. Each year Congress sends a delegation and most years I am part of the group that attends. This year, I flew overnight on Thursday from Boston and arrived in Munich on Friday morning. The conference has two stages (with two simultaneous programs) and dozens of meeting rooms for meetings called bilats bilateral meetings between leaders of two countries. During the weekend, I spent most of my time in bilats with various foreign leaders and very little time in the main halls listening to the official program. Sometimes the meetings are very small; for instance, on Friday afternoon, Senator Chris Van Hollen and I did back-to-back bilats with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Greek Prime Minster Kyriakos Mitsotakis. I met alone with the UN Special Representative for Yemen Hans Grundberg and Montenegrin President Jakov Milatovic. Our entire Senate delegation of about a dozen members met with Jordans King Abdullah II. Meeting with my friend Albin Kurti, Prime Minister of Kosovo, in Munich. This year, all eyes were on the American congressional delegation and the question of whether the United States is going to stand by or abandon Ukraine. Of course, it was a hard question to answer. The Senate had just passed the national security supplemental bill, which includes funding to support Ukraine, and so our Senate delegation could confidently state that we had done our job (interestingly, some of the Senators who voted against Ukraine aid, like Lindsey Graham, bailed on the trip to Munich at the last minute presumably so they wouldnt have to explain their no votes). But House passage is far less certain, and while I told foreign leaders I thought House approval was better than a 50/50 chance, I honestly do not know if that will happen with a Speaker who seems unable to pass even the simplest measures through the body. Speaking on a panel discussion in Munich on the crisis in the Red Sea and the future of Yemen. On Saturday night, I attended a small dinner hosted by my friend, Alex Soros, President of the Open Society Foundation. The dinner table consisted of Alex, me, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, and four Balkan leaders: the Presidents of Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia, and the Prime Minister of Albania. All of us know each other well, and so the conversation was boisterous, candid, and funny. Prime Minister Edi Rama, an old friend, was in rare form. He told long, funny stories about his adventures in the region, and he traded jokes and barbs with the regional leaders and Americans at the table. Sometimes it was hard to get a word in edgewise. But at one point, Albanian PM Rama made a pointed and serious remark: Chris, if you let Ukraine go to Russia, it will be very hard in our region. It will be very hard for people to trust you. The most important thing for you in the Balkans is Ukraine. Sunday: Budapest, Hungary On Sunday morning, I boarded a small military plane with Senator Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina (and my co-author of the 2022 bipartisan gun safety bill), bound for Budapest, Hungary. We went to Budapest for two reasons: to push the pro-Russian government of President Viktor Orbn to pass legislation allowing Sweden to join NATO, and to show support for pro-democracy activists who are fighting Orbans anti-democratic consolidation of power. We were greeted at the airport by our impressive Ambassador, David Pressman, with interesting news: Orbns government had decided to boycott our visit. Our bipartisan delegation represented the highest-level congressional delegation in years, but Orbn wanted to make a point that he would not be pressured by the United States. Not only would Orbn not meet with us, but he prohibited every single member of his party, down to the most junior member of Parliament, from seeing us. We stopped at Pressmans house to get a briefing from embassy officials, and he gave us some startling advice. I think you should tell the press what you think of Orbns refusal to meet. And I wouldnt hold back on what you think of his decision to be the last country to approve Swedens membership, even though he swore Hungary would not be the holdout, he told us. Meeting with our great U.S. Ambassador to Hungary David Pressman in Budapest. I have found over my years of foreign diplomacy that many of our embassies are allergic to conflict they dont want to upset their host country, even when the host country is involved in behavior directly contrary to American interests. This reluctance to speak publicly against bad policy is understandable but over the years I have viewed it as a weakness of our diplomacy. It was sound, refreshing advice. Orbn is a classic bully who thinks that by engaging in confrontational behavior, he will never be confronted in return. And history shows that when you stand up to Orbn (as Europe did last month because of his refusal to vote for an economic aid package for Ukraine), he often does the right thing. After our meetings with civil society leaders and members of the opposition parties, we headed to the embassy for a dramatic press conference. The room was packed maybe a dozen cameras and fifty reporters. Shaheen, Tillis and I have traveled together before (In fact, it was on our trip to the Balkans in April of 2022 where Tillis and I became friends, leading to our partnership on the gun bill), so we have confidence that we can effectively deliver a coordinated, tough message when we need to. Shaheen and Tillis didnt hold back on their push for Hungary to join NATO and their disappointment that Orbn wouldnt meet. I went a little further. Im going to be honest with you President Orbns refusal to meet is really strange and concerning. We arent coming with a political agenda. We are a bipartisan delegation seeking to strengthen our two countries partnership. We knew our comments would make the story of our visit Orbns refusal to meet. But we werent afraid of it we thought that maybe by outing his petulant tactic we could press him to move forward on Swedens NATO bid. Monday: Chiinu, Moldova Tillis broke away from our trip to attend a Helsinki Commission meeting, leaving Shaheen and I to continue on to Moldova, a small country that sits on the southwest border of Ukraine. If Ukraine falls, Putin will possibly set his sights on Moldova, another former Soviet state. Shaheen and I wanted to go to Moldova to highlight the consequences of allowing Putin to win in Ukraine and to show support for the strong pro-American and anti-corruption government of President Maia Sandu. Meeting with President of Moldova Maia Sandu. I was thrilled to meet Sandu, a former World Bank economist who is diminutive in stature but larger than life in the presence she commands. She watches Putin carefully, and she confirmed our fears that if handed Ukraine, Moldova will be the next target. She explained that Putin was not waiting for an invasion, but rather has already begun running a massive propaganda, bribery, and vote buying campaign to try to undermine her government. She wanted help to fight back. So we left her office to go meet with a team of anti-corruption and counter propaganda groups that are working with the support of U.S. funds and a relatively new counter-propaganda agency at the State Department, the Center for Global Engagement (GEC). I helped found the GEC with former Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman through legislation we passed in 2016. Shaheen and I received a chilling briefing about the extent of Russias covert efforts to undermine the press and buy the upcoming elections, and we left determined to beef up the GECs resources for Moldova. As we wrapped up our meetings in Chisinau, we received interesting news. That afternoon, Orbns government announced that as soon as the spring parliamentary session begins on February 26, they will vote to approve Swedens application to join NATO. It is unlikely the timing of the announcement was purely coincidental to our decision to publicly confront Orbn the day before. Pressmans advice had been prescient. Tuesday and Wednesday: Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey The final stop of our trip was a visit to Turkey, a NATO partner and key player in Middle East politics. In the capital of Ankara our dance card was full: President Erdoans government was enthusiastic to meet with us. There is new momentum in our two countries often strained partnership. Last month, Turkey ended its long delay in supporting Swedens NATO application, and Congress approved a major sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. In our meetings, we thanked the Turkish government for this new cooperative spirit and we searched for additional common ground. The issue I raised repeatedly was the concerning trend of private companies using Turkey to evade U.S. anti-Russia sanctions and send goods that can be stripped and converted for defense use into Russia. This is happening at an alarming rate, and we were briefed that the Turks would claim that they want to crack down on companies who are sending defense articles to Russia, but they are just waiting on information from the U.S. on those companies. I have to be honest with you, I told Mehmet Simsek, the impressive Finance Minister, from what I understand, in many cases your government has all the information you need. The problem isnt that we havent given you the information. The problem is you havent acted on it. I think my directness was surprising to Simsek, and he suggested setting up a formal Turkey-U.S. working group to go after sanctions evaders. It was a very positive suggestion and another sign of our two nations improving alliance. At the end of day, we went to the majestic presidential palace of Recep Tayyip Erdoan, Turkeys imposing and powerful leader. He doesnt take many meetings with visiting U.S. members of Congress, and so we were glad to be able to meet him in person. Meeting with Turkeys imposing and powerful leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoan. There were no surprises in our meeting. We discussed a wide range of topics, from Gaza and Ukraine to the Balkans and Iran. Our meeting ran long, and as it ended he told us, through his translator, that he was next seeing our recent dinner partner, Edi Rama. We left the presidential palace to head to the airport and took our small plane to Istanbul. We had to make one more stop, in the city where many of the pro-democracy activists are based. Like Hungary, Erdoans government has a concerning history of stifling free speech (Turkey was in the top 10 jailers of journalists worldwide last year, and has consistently vied with China for #1 in recent years), and before leaving we wanted to meet with leading writers and journalists to show our support for free speech in Turkey. Just meeting with us today sends a strong message to the government that the U.S. has our back, said one of the attendees. In the early afternoon, we headed to the airport to board flights back to the United States, confident that we had made a difference in supporting our countries efforts to strengthen NATO and support Ukraine at this vital time. When I travel, I am always realistic about the impact I can have. I am not a direct representative of President Biden, but I am a close ally, and I know the Administration can not be everywhere at once. Our trip was a perfect example about how smart, strategic congressional diplomacy can help advance key U.S. interests. - Chris is up for reelection in 2024, and we have an important FEC deadline coming up at the end of March.

But theres plenty more to do for working people in Massachusetts and across the country. Weve got to bring down the cost of housing. Put child care within reach for all working parents. Protect our Commonwealth from the climate crisis. Take power away from powerful interests like Big Pharma, Big Oil, and big banks and put it in the hands of working people which means we need to root corruption out of Washington. And Ive got the most sweeping set of anti-corruption plans since Watergate. This election is about who our government works for and its about defending our democracy and our basic freedoms. Im fighting to keep our Senate majority because if Republicans win any more power, theyll restrict abortion access everywhere, even in blue states that have passed abortion protections like Massachusetts. Theyll threaten voting rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act theyll reward the rich and powerful, and embolden an extremist base across the country. So Im staying in this fight to stop MAGA extremism, continue standing up to powerful special interests, and make real change for working people. Are you with me? Please respond to my opponents announcement today with a donation for or anything you can to support this campaign and Chris Murphys re-election. Grassroots supporters like you have helped defeat the GOP and special interests in the past, and I need your support again as we take on this new fight.

Trump is privately telling his advisors and allies that he would support a national 16-week abortion ban. But theyre not stopping there. His allies are making a Day One plan to use sweeping executive powers including at the FDA, Health and Human Services, the NIH and the Department of Justice to restrict abortion rights. One of their number one goals is to use a dormant 1873 law to criminalize mailing anything used in abortion care including drugs like mifepristone because they know that abortion medication covers the majority of abortions today. And this is only what has leaked so far. Trump knows that this is a losing issue, and he is desperately trying to conceal the full extent of their plans. We cannot let this happen. We need to make sure everybody knows exactly what Trump is planning and organize up and down the ballot to defeat Republicans efforts to ban abortion nationwide. Please contribute anything you can afford to our campaign today. Chris will put every dollar to work to elect Democrats who will vote to abolish the filibuster and protect abortion access nationwide. DONATE: The details of their plan come on the heels of Trump taking full credit for overturning Roe v. Wade. [For] 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it. And Im proud to have done it. - Donald Trump If we give Trump and his allies the chance, they will absolutely limit and ban abortion access as much as they can. Republican-controlled states have shown us that for over a year. The stakes in November are high. This isnt just a chance to stop Trump from restricting abortion in every state. This is our chance to elect a majority that will pass federal legislation to restore and protect abortion access in every state. If you are with us in this fight, please make a contribution today to support Chris Murphys reelection and organizing work. We must make Trump and his Republican allies pay a price for their dangerous agenda. DONATE: -Team Murphy DONATE: You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:',\n  '[1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy Youve probably heard us say before that small-dollar donations allow Chris to spend more time focused on the work we elected him to do. So we wanted to take a moment to break that down with a real-time example. Right now, Chris is on a trip to attend the the Munich Security Conference and meet with officials in Budapest, Hungary as part of his job on the Foreign Relations Committee. Its happening at a critical moment for us to make clear that we are committed to strengthening NATO and beating back against Putins aggression. This trip is right on the heels of nonstop negotiations that Chris led with Republicans on the border and Ukraine funding the one that they demanded then blew up before the ink dried. He spent every day for four months with only two exceptions Thanksgiving and Christmas trying to write a bipartisan bill. And none of that would have been possible without you and the movement weve built together. Chris made the bet a long time ago that, if he focused more on the work of being a legislator and limited his time fundraising, people would appreciate that approach and have his back when he needed it. If you appreciate this approach, will you please make a contribution to our campaign today? Every donation gives Chris more time to focus on this important work without worrying about our fundraising. DONATE: Chris counts himself as lucky among his colleagues to have people like you as part of this incredible movement. Most members of Congress have to spend hours on end dialing for dollars. Chris can spend way less time worrying about fundraising when we have his back. But the truth is, we did have to cancel some fundraisers and leave money on the table to make sure Chris had all of this time to focus on the work over the past few months. So if youre able to help us out right now, this is one of those times where it will make a big difference. We need everyone who believes in Chris and who cares about the work hes doing to make meaningful progressive change to have his back. So if you can afford it, make a contribution to Chris Murphys reelection today. Please know your support is the reason Chris is one of the most effective leaders when it comes to fighting for our shared values.

Maybe $5 doesnt feel like it matters in a Senate race like ours, but heres why it does: $5 because every dollar goes directly toward building political power for our movement and holding our Senate majority. $5 because over 95% of donations come from people giving $100 or less. $5 because most people will delete this email without giving, and it makes your donation that much more important to whether or not were successful.

DONATE: -Team Murphy You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:',\n  '[1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy From the start of this campaign, one of Chris commitments to you was to always be honest in our fundraising. He promised not to rely on scare tactics or fake triple matches to raise money. At his core, Chris is an optimist doom and gloom is not how you bring people into a movement thats serious about making real change. So were reaching out today, about halfway to our next end-of-quarter FEC deadline, with an honest ask to help us reach our goals. This is when we have to start picking up our pace. Now some in Washington would tell Chris hes wrong for being this honest. That the fear, fake mid-month deadlines, and scams like triple matches are a better way to raise more money, but we think theyre wrong. And with your help, we can prove it. If you believe this is the right way to raise money, can you please contribute to Chris Murphys reelection today? This is a true grassroots effort not a dime from PACs or corporations. DONATE: Now that Chris is up for reelection, theres pressure on our campaign to raise the resources necessary to hold this seat. The reality is that, even in a state like Connecticut, Senate races are outrageously expensive. Our goals are modest compared to states like Ohio and Montana, but its just as important that we reach them. Were not trying to break records or raise money just for the sake of saying we can. What we raise will go directly toward our work to help reelect Chris and his colleagues who are key to the House and Senate majorities. So if you can, please contribute to help us pick up the pace toward our goals ahead of our next FEC deadline. Chris does not take PAC or corporate money, so contributions from people like you are that much more important. DONATE: Thank you in advance.

It was a moment that once again shook our nation. And sadly as we mark this occasion, we once again are confronting breaking news about a shooting at the Super Bowl parade in Kansas City. We hold these communities in our hearts today. In the years since Parkland, our movement has grown strong enough to rival the gun lobby. In 2022, Chris led the effort to break the logjam in Washington to pass the first significant federal gun safety legislation in three decades. But we know it is not enough. School shootings continue. Within the past year, weve seen shootings at schools in Michigan, Iowa and North Carolina, but those are just the shootings that dominated national headlines. As Kansas City reminds us so clearly, gun violence happens every day in America, and we cannot get complacent or let up. We must keep the pressure on for federal action. Universal background checks and an assault weapons ban are two of the most popular and common sense steps we could take. Few ideas have such broad bipartisan support from the public.

We need to make sure they pay the price. Please pitch in today to help us defeat them at the ballot box and hold the Senate majority. Im fuming. For the past four months, I worked tirelessly to cut a deal with Republicans that would allow us to pass funding for Ukraine and prevent Russia from turning Kyiv into a Russian city. Despite the bipartisan support for Ukraine, Republicans told us in October that they would only agree to support Ukraine if we paired it with policy changes for the border. So I stepped forward to negotiate with Republicans to work on a bipartisan deal. I came into these negotiations skeptical but sincere. And against the odds, we made an agreement. It wasnt easy. We met every day for months every single day except for Thanksgiving and Christmas. But this week, not even 24 hours after the deal was announced, Republicans killed the bill that their own leadership negotiated. Before the ink was even dry, they were tweeting their opposition all because Donald Trump demanded it. This is unbelievable. People elected us to solve problems. But Donald Trump and Republicans have made it clear that they want the chaos at the border. They dont want to fix the border. They think its good politics for them in November to use a broken border as a perpetual political cudgel. Honestly, its embarrassing for Republicans. They have proven they cannot be trusted to be in charge, so we must secure a majority that believes in functional government. Let me be clear: Im not giving up on Ukraine funding. This is a global imperative for our security and the future of every single democracy, and I refuse to let Republicans get away with what they did this week.

And in return for their intervention, he made this pledge to them: 'I will never let you down - Trump tells the NRA' From the moment he was elected president, Trump worked hard to return the favor. Now, hes making clear today that, if they return him to the Oval Office once again, then hell be in the gun lobbys pocket to push their agenda. Its our job to make sure that doesnt happen.

Brian is an Air Force veteran, trauma surgeon, and a member of the team Murphy family. Just like so many in our movement, the issue of gun violence found him. In 2016, he rose to national attention when he led the team that operated on Dallas police officers who were shot during a peaceful protest against police brutality. Three died on his watch when they were there trying to protect young people exercising their rights. And it is Brians voice, as a Black trauma surgeon, that broke through as a community grieved and tried to make sense of what happened. In 2022, Chris hired him to join our fight to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He worked tirelessly to help us break the gun lobbys 30-year grip on Congress, and now hes taking on his next mission running for the open-seat in TX-32. Please split a donation between Dr. Brian Williams campaign and our reelection today to help us grow our gun safety movements power in Congress. CONTRIBUTE: Brian will bring an important perspective and voice to Congress. He knows what it is like to have to tell a parent their child wont survive. He also understands what its like to operate on an expecting mother experiencing a deadly pregnancy complication. He brings a powerful frontline experience, and he will help our movement build power in Washington to end gun violence, restore abortion rights, and deliver real progress for working families. But hes going to face his first test at the ballot box in just 30 days. This is an important test of our movements strength, so we need to do all we can to make sure he has the resources to win.

Over 95% of our donations come from folks giving $100 or less and not a dime from PACs or corporations. Thank you so much for being a donor.

I love this work being your voice and representing Connecticut in the U.S. Senate means the world to me. So much has happened in these two years. Most importantly for me, we defied the odds and passed the first major gun safety bill in 30 years. As the author and champion of the bill, I know that the gun lobby is coming after me. And after we passed climate legislation and drug pricing legislation, I know the oil companies and drug industry are coming too. So I am counting on a lot of grassroots support as we kick off this race. Will you please make a contribution to my re-election today to make sure were ready for whatever comes our way? Grassroots donations are the heart of our campaign. It is what allows me to focus on and deliver meaningful progressive change in the U.S. Senate. CONTRIBUTE: When I came to the Senate, there was a feeling of defeat amongst progressives. For decades, we had tried unsuccessfully to pass transformative legislation to lower carbon emissions. We had struck out, again and again, trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs. And we had been stymied, for three long decades, by the gun lobby. I ran for the Senate to be part of the group that would upend this status quo. And we did. We passed the biggest gun safety bill in nearly three decades, lowered prescription drug costs, made major investments in Americas infrastructure, and delivered the most aggressive climate action bill ever. Slowly but surely, we are shifting the power back from billionaires and corporations to the American people. But the status quo fights back. And I know that the billionaires and the gun companies are going to throw the kitchen sink at me this campaign. So I cannot do this alone. The truth is Senate campaigns require significant resources, so I am asking for your support to help me start this re-election campaign strong: Please contribute any amount you can afford to my re-election today. Its important that we send a powerful message about the strength of our movement, and the donation itself is just as important as the amount. CONTRIBUTE: When we win, I plan to build on the success of the past two years. We need to pass voting rights legislation, restore the right to an abortion, and build on our 2022 gun safety bill by passing universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.

Building a people-powered movement from top to bottom makes us that much more powerful and capable of making real change in Washington.

But Chris is not taking a dime from ANY PACs. Thats a big change from how Washington thinks we should run this campaign. Hes the first to admit that he took this money previously. But its not worth it to him. Special interests and corporations shouldnt get special access, and he wants to make it 100% clear that working families always have and always will come first for him.

Today, for the first time in our history, guns outpace car accidents as the leading cause of death for children in America. For most of your life and mine, car accidents have been the number one cause of death. What changed? With changes in laws and safety standards and innovation from the government and the car industry, the number of deaths fell significantly. This is why so many of us as parents worry every day.

With a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll ( ) showing Republican former Governor Larry Hogan beating U.S. House Representative David Trone and Prince Georges County Executive Angela Alsobrooks Angela by 12 (49%-37%) and 14 (50%-36%) points, respectively, it is clear we are in very serious danger of losing Ben Cardins long-held seat to Republicans, and that would be a disaster for Democrats efforts to sand up to insurrectionist ( ) Trumps MAGA fascism ( ) no matter how nice Larry may seem or how popular he is in Maryland: asa Republican in the Senate, he would vote far too often with Trumps insane ( ) MAGA cult ( ) . Most people I run into in Maryland and ask in Maryland Who is running for U.S. Senate? cant even name Trone and Alsobrooks, but more people know Hogan is running. But that is not anecdotal: the poll bears this reality out, too, as voters had no opinion of them, 46% when it came to Trone and 58% compared to Alsobrooks, while Hogan had a 64% favorable rating. None of this bodes well for keeping the retiring Democratic Senator Ben Cardins seat in Democrats hands. Rather, these are signs we will lose if the two frontrunners dont change their approach to their campaigns, if the Democratic Party organizations in Maryland dont change how there are organizing primary events and coordinate more, if media does not start prioritizing covering the primary, and if the candidates, Democratic Party organs, and media do not among themselves better, it is far more likely that Larry Hogan will take over Ben Cardins seat and that is unacceptable. They have all had a lot of time going well back into last year to have approached this differently. Assuming Larry Hogan was not going to run is no excuse: a series of highly coordinated, highly covered, highly televised or at least properly recorded eventsthis has not happened at the first three debates, the first of which was only this past Decembercould easily have been crafted before last December. We could have been generating for more enthusiasm, name recognition, and buzz around this race and these candidates. We as Democrats have not. Does this mean we are doomed to failure? No. Certainly not. It may be too late, but it may not be and I do not intent to hand this seat to Larry Hogan without a real fight. But right now the two frontrunners are failing and they seem too comfortable doing what they have been doing, not in challenging each other on substance or changing course to put us on a path to victory in November. Right now, this process is not bringing out the best of the frontrunners to enough people. Which bring us to how that latest poll was conducted shamefully: the only previous comparably respectable poll from a month ago has 14% of voters choosing other candidates ( #gid=0 ) , including myself at 1% (technically 1.2%, and far from the lowest, ha, but keep in mind that was before I was the only second-tier candidate mentioned by any top-tier news outlet two debates in a row over the past few weeks, as I have noted in detail before ( ) ; give my media dominance among the second-tiers, I think it totally reasonable that I could have expected a bounce and maybe even broken away into a clear third place1). In that earlier poll form mid-February, collectively we second-tiers came to about as much as Alsobrooks\\'s 17%. Trone was far ahead in that poll, 32%, but the true winner was \"Undecided\" coming in at 37%. That aforementioned latest poll clocked in 39% for \"Undecided\" in the Democratic primary, with Trone at 34%, then Alsobrooks at 27%. The earlier poll was conducted by Emerson/The Hill, a different outfit from the Washington PostUMD folks that conducted the latest poll, so I would really like to see each pollster with subsequent polls to compare to their own polls rather than each other to get a real sense of trends and momentum. For now, with just two polls and so little to work with, I would view each as a snapshot from different pollsters and different sampling methodology rather than as representative of trends from one month to another, but with giving more credence to the most recent poll. With so much uncertainty in this race and so many undecideds in both polls, and with the only other poll besides the most recent one having myself and the other second-tier candidates cumulatively nearly equaling Alsobrooks\\'s support, it was unconscionable that the Post/UMD poll not completely omitted all us second-tier candidates and did not even include an \"other\" option. Deliberate presents not just a distorted picture, but an unfair and biased one. Perhaps I could have risen to 5%, 10%, or who knows; the higher the less likely, to be sure, but any bounce elevating me might have put in a clear third place and made me part of the conversation. Excluding that prevents that for now, unless a journalist resent at tonight\\'s or another debate or another poll mentions me favorably, Time will tell, but the Post/UMD pollsters should have striven for more accuracy and inclusivity in the way most good pollsters do in uncertain races like this with more obscure characters. So the time is now, dear Marylanders, to bring a third person into this race, to shake things up, to press the frontrunners on their weaknesses and failed approaches before Larry Hogan does so they can properly address them when he does, to on end forge them into better general election candidates or even offer an alternative to them on the other end of that spectrum. Right now we are failing, but I am just what this race needs to shake it upto light a fire under our collective asseseven if I am not the eventual nominee, and yet perhaps I will, perhaps I should be, since we the status quo has been a train wreck that has put us in a hole against Larry Hogan in a blue state like our great Maryland. I sure as hell dont want to Larry Hogan and Republicans to win. So support me for now even if you support David or Angela because we need help, the status quo is obviously not working, and I am the that third candidate that can change this race to put whomever is going to be the nomineeDavid, Angela, or myselfin the best position to win for Democrats, Maryland, and this nation in the fall.

Furthermore, as women are supposed to be treated as equal citizens, I would argue one could look at constitutional equal protection issues in having government take a paternal, patriarchal approach to women exercising their full autonomy on reproductive rights as equal citizens. But in the end, Republican positions on reproductive rights and abortion are ridiculous, hypocritical, and gross violation of the rights of American women and families. Mothers, their partners if any, and their doctors are the qualified parties to decide how to handle pregnancy, birth, and reproductive health, not partisan legislators with agendas not based on medical science or ethics, nor the best interests of the mother. -- Manage Subscriptions Unsubscribe:',\n  \"Post : Frydenborg Finishes Third in Debate: Only Candidate After Trone, Alsobrooks Quoted by Washington Post &#038; Baltimore Sun URL : Posted : March 2, 2024 at 10:13 pm Author : Brian Frydenborg Tags : Campaign events, Democracy, Politics Categories : Newsletter Even the greatest projects start small.

Dave Trone and Country Executive Angela Alsobrooksa run for their money is tomorrow, in Silver Spring, MD. Alarmingly, there have been almost no debates between the candidates so far, none as high profile as this, and the primary is To explain why this event and others like it are so important, I want to tell a story from the incredible book ( ) Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union, by local son of Maryland Scott Shane, a friend and mentor and an incredible reporter and author who covered crime, national security, and the Soviet Union/Russia for decades first at The Baltimore Sun (as a result he played himself on The Wire!) and later at The New York Times, winning two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting. He tells the story of a young, boyish physicist named Arkady Murashyov who ran in the 1989 Soviet elections for the Congress of Peoples deputies, the first contested elections Russia in over seventy years since the 1917 election that the Communist Bolsheviks made sure did not end up counting for much on their quest for power by coup and terror. Debates between candidates were televised live, and in one race in a district north of Moscow, the unknown Murashyov debated older, better-known, and more conservative competitors for over two hours, arguing that Communist one-party rule was the root of all the USSRs problems. Amazinglyin a society under some of the worst oppression on earth for some seven decades with no competitive elections or free debates in public throughout this eraMurashyov won the seat and became the leader of the Congresss radical wing. As Shane writes ( ) : Without the televised debate the unknown Murashyov might well have lost. This says everything about why I need this debate and am counting on attendees and viewers to spread the word about what I know will be a powerful appearance by myself. Voters need more exposure, not less, from their candidates. It is remarkable that in 2024, Maryland has had such a closed race with so few events in which the candidates can stand up to public scrutiny and scrutinize each other with now there being only ten weeks left until the primary and early voting beginning before then. Instead of being about name recognition of spending on television advertisements, lets make this race about ideas, plans, and qualifications. Let me be your Murashyov, a breakout star who can upend this race and be an injection of youth and fresh ideas I am ready to run with hard for Maryland and the nation.

Because of the Senates innate bias towards ( ) far less-populated ( ) , far more rural ( ) , far whiter ( ) state populations, the Republican senators who have engaged in creating this imbalance have represented roughly 39 million ( ) to, most recently, 54 million fewer Americans ( ) in recent years than Senate Democrats. This is clearly a tyranny of an unrepresentative minority. But we can fight back, in numerous ways. On top of my recent proposals to reduce the threshold of the filibuster ( ) from 60 votes to 55 and expand the U.S. Supreme Court ( ) by four more seats to 13 total, I am supporting the campaigns for statehood for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, both of which would help adjust the unrepresentative bias against nonwhite, non-rural voters in the Senate, making passing the legislations we need to much more likely. Puerto Rico was acquired by the U.S. ( ) during the Spanish-American War in 1898 and has had an odd history or being autonomous to varying degrees but today is in a no-mans land of not being an actual state; its 3.2 million people are U.S. citizens ( ) but reside in what is now classified as a U.S. Territory: that means it has no representatives with binding, counting votes in either the U.S. House or the U.S. Senate even though the island territory has more people than roughly twenty of the U.S. states ( ) that collectively account for roughly 40 out of 100 Senate votes. And this has had consequences that have harmed Puerto Rico ( ) , one glaring example being the inability of its people to hold the U.S. government accountable for the gross disparity ( ) in hurricane rescue, relief, and aid efforts ( ) from the federal government after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico compared with federal efforts ( ) to assist states hurt by hurricanes around the same time, such as Florida after Hurricane Irma and Texas after Hurricane Harvey ( ) . Were this Puerto Ricos status to change and it to be admitted as a state into the Union, the territory turned state would be given House seats and, like every other state, two U.S. Senate seats. While Puerto Ricans views and votes on statehood have evolved over time, the three latest votesin 2012, 2017, and 2020all had a majority ( ) of Puerto Rican voters in favor of statehood. We also have close to six million Puerto Ricans living ( ) in the U.S. mainland who can be approached and engaged in this effort, too, and we should be honest: the wonderful, hardworking Puerto Rican people are Americans, adding their wonderful culture to our tapestry of many cultures. We can approach Puerto Ricans not acting like we are doing them a favor in granting statehood (though statehood could help Puerto Rico in important ways ( ) ), but be clear we are asking them for their help. We can make it clear that we want them to join us as fully equal political citizens and that we could really use their help rectifying the gross imbalances in our political system, fighting for justice and policies that benefit all Americans. A bipartisan bill to move forward with a new binding vote on statehood in Puerto Rice passed the House late in 2022 ( ) , but was never taken up in the Senate. As that bipartisan coalition wants to continue its effort ( ) , I mean to be a vocal leader in the Senate on this effort: we should ( ) put Puerto Rico on the official path ( ) to statehood as soon as possible. The same goes for the city of Washington as the District of Columbia. There are many reasons why ( ) Washington, DC should have statehood, most famous being the simple principle that the Americans whose primary residence is DC suffer from what the Colonial-era American patriots complained of: taxation without representation, for many years ( ) now part of the phrasing on local DC license plates ( ) . DC has more people than two statesVermont and Wyoming ( ) that each have their own representatives in the House and two senators each in the Senate, too. Furthermore, many of the Washingtonians whose primary residence is the District are those who serve and work for our federal government and enable it to operate on a day-to-day basis while many others are descendants of freedman, the former slaves who settled in Washington ( ) often as refugees before ( ) , during, and after the Civil War: it seems terribly wrong to deny so many public servants and their families and so many who are the descendants of those who suffered from Americas Original Sin of slavery the representation in Congress that all Americans living primarily in the fifty states have. While there may ( ) (or may not ( ) ) be some potential constitutional issues ( ) with making a federal district a state, we still must press forward with the campaign to give ( ) the U.S. citizens of Washington, District of Columbia equal rights as U.S. citizens in the form of full representation in the Congress, in both the House and with two Senators in the Senate. I will be a leading voice on this effort and try to tie it to the effort to give the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico full representation, too. Not only will making Puerto Rico and Washington full states with full delegations in Congress help address the unfair, unjustifiable bias against non-rural and non-white Americans in the Senate, it will also help bring balance to a House that has been gerrymandered for years ( ) to disproportionately benefit Republicans ( ) . I will help lead the fight to do to justice not only for Marylanders in Maryland, but for Washingtonians in the District of Colombia, Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico, and Americans in the nation as a whole in the U.S. Senate. -- Manage Subscriptions Unsubscribe:',\n  'Post : U.S. Senate Candidate Brian Frydenborg Supports U.S. Supreme Court Expansion by Four JusticesURL : Posted : February 28, 2024 at 1:32 amAuthor : Brian FrydenborgCategories : Domestic Policy Brian Frydenborg respects fairness. The American people deserve a Supreme Court that represents them and something approximating their views. Instead, because of Senate Republicans cheating and blatant hypocrisy in blocking Merrick Garlands nomination for most of a year and then Trump got the benefit of the stubbornness of the late and legendary Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg combined with even more blatant Republican hypocrisy to make the balance in the Supreme Court 6-3 in favor of conservatives instead of 5-4 in favor of liberals. This is absolutely out of step with American values and has led to the loss of rights for all women in America in the notorious Dobbs case that overturned Roe v. Wade. But we do not have to take this lying down. We do not have to accept a 6-3 right-wing Supreme Court for decades. In line with precedent and the U.S. Constitution, we can and should expand the number of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court by four, from nine to fourteen. Senators Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota have already introduced legislation ( ) to do this, and as a U.S. Senator, it would be my intention to fully and vigorously support their legislation and to push for its adoption as soon as Democrats would have the numbers in Congress to make this a reality. The Supreme Court is broken. This 6-3 imbalance does not represent the views of the vast majority of Americans and we do not deserve to be held back by a reactionary judiciary. Because of the Senates innate bias towards ( ) far less-populated ( ) , far more rural ( ) , far whiter ( ) state populations, the Republican senators who have engaged in creating this imbalance have represented roughly 39 million ( ) to, most recently, 54 million fewer Americans ( ) in recent years than Senate Democrats. This is clearly a tyranny of a minority. Accidents of history and blatant political gamesmanship should not define the makeup the Supreme Court, and such a grave, radical imbalance requires a bold solution, one that refuses to accept the status quo imposed by a group of senators representing a minority of the U.S. population. We definitely have to win more seats in the Senate, but my proposal to reduce the filibuster threshold from 60 to 55 seats ( ) will make this much easier and a near-term realistic goal if we turn out and vote just a few more Democrats into the Senate (including me!)!

But Republicans have blatantly abused this tradition and this rule for years now allowing a much smaller minority to thwart the will of much larger majorities. Because of the Senates innate bias towards ( ) far less-populated ( ) , far more rural ( ) , far whiter ( ) state populations, the Republican senators blocking progress in the country in recent years have represented roughly 39 million ( ) to, most recently, 54 million fewer Americans ( ) in recent years than Senate Democrats. This is clearly a tyranny of a minority. At the same time, a narrow factional majority should not be able to impose its will on the nation by just one vote, and the Senates tradition of forcing some consensus should not be abandoned: sweeping legislation should be able to be passed with more than just a narrow tiny majority, ideally bipartisan. The filibuster in concept will also protect us as Democrats, protect others not aligned with Republicans when electoral fortunes shift. And it also in concept means less back and forth with the country seeing legislation undone and redone with just a one-vote majority or a tie with a vice presidential vote in the Senate, too. Therefore, instead of needing 60 votes and having a 20-vote majority required on non-budget reconciliation ( ) measures in the Senate, I propose to reduce the filibuster to 55 votes, reducing a 20-vote margin to a 10-vote margin for these changes. This will dramatically reduce the abuse, increase the chances for bipartisanship, and allow America to move forward more often while still doing so with some care and respect for the minority. Democrats can change the rule now and I would be a strong vote and advocate for this change once I would be a member of the Senate.

And student loan debt is simply out of control and too exploitative for too many borrowers. In fact, a sizable minority27% ( ) of all borrowers owe more in interest than their original principal amount borrowed 12 years after they took out their loans; we find this policy is racist as it is nearly twice as high a rate52%for African-Americans. There is no way that borrowers should end up owing more than their initial loan in interest or anywhere near that. I therefore propose to limit the total amount in interest owed on any student loan to be 50% of the principal; once the interest amount hits 50% of the original borrowed amount, no more interest may be charged, period. This will save millions of borrowers thousands of dollars over time and protect them from excessive, punitive interest accruing over time, especially Africa-Americans, who are exploited by lenders the most. -- Manage Subscriptions Unsubscribe:',\n  'Post : Candidate for U.S. Seante for Maryland Brian Frydenborg Proposes Legislation with Major New Credit Card Regulations to Protect ConsumersURL : Posted : February 18, 2024 at 7:08 pmAuthor : Brian FrydenborgTags : Economic/financial policyCategories : Domestic Policy Predatory credit card practices are drowning millions of Americans in debt and bankruptcy, in a regressive system where those who are the least able to pay are charged the highest interest rates and minimum payments.

The year 2022 saw a record $130 billion ( ) in credit card interest and fees charged to consumers and the amount of credit card debt hit an all-time high in the last quarter of 2023, some $1.05 trillion ( ) . Some of the worst offenders are large, corporate banks ( ) that are hardly struggling. And this burden is hitting lower- and middle-income Americans the most ( ) , who are given the highest rates and are trapped in many cases from being able to pay off their debt, as those most exploited by credit card issuers and charged the highest interest are those least able to pay them ( ) . Even 20% is still pretty damn high. That rate still allows banks to make plenty of profits while being a third less than a very common interest rate today of 29.99%, which is far too high. As a candidate for U.S. Senate for the great state of Maryland, I am officially proposing a federal limit on all credit cards: interest must be less than 20%, including penalty APR. And I will introduce this bill on the floor soon after taking office. If one of the consequences for this is that people who are enjoying lower interest rates that are much more reasonable see an increase to offset the limits on interest for poorer lenders, a few thoughts on that: those people are doing much better and can be a lot more selective, they will be better able to choose alternatives, the market rewarding companies that are fairer on interest rates, and if those who are better off end up paying more in interest, I would much rather have that be the case than the poorest and those who are struggling being exploited and slapped with interest rates in excess of 20%. And another rule I will make is that any increase in interest and in the minimum payment amount or any reductions in a credit line must be notified in advance to the consumer at least four billing cycles ahead. This will prevent greedy, sneaky companies from throwing consumers into a lurch and lower the levels of bankruptcy and hardship among working and struggling Americans. I am calling this proposal the Credit Card Interest and Changes Fairness Act and I believe it can get enough support to pass Congress and become law. -- Manage Subscriptions Unsubscribe:',\n  'Subscribed! = Congratulations, you are now subscribed to the site \"BRIAN FRYDENBORG FOR U.S. SENATE FOR MARYLAND\" (brian4md.com) and will receive an email notification when a new post is made.

WATCH HERE < < About six years ago on January 2nd, 2018 - Kris, Abel, and I entered the Oval Office for a meeting with President Trump. He had invited us to talk about advancing his America First agenda and to try and convince us about our decision not to seek office in the United States Senate from North Dakota. We had fielded multiple pleas about running for Senate and each time, Kris and I considered the requests sincerely and prayerfully and each time concluded it was not in what was the best interest of our family and that remaining in the house with my seniority and important committee assignments was what was best for North Dakota. Later that week I announced once and for all I would seek re-election to the United States House of Representatives. Then on February 8th the day of the National Prayer Breakfast President Trump, armed with compelling poll numbers, called again with a simple message. He said, Kevin, we've looked at all of the poll numbers and candidates and the fact of the matter is simply this if you run, Republicans will win the seat. If you dont run, Democrats will keep the seat. I need you. Kris looked at me and said I guess we have to do it! And weve never looked back. Representing North Dakota in the Senate is the honor of a lifetime. With now six years invested in the Senate Ive learned to leverage North Dakotas strengths with Americas needs. Ive gained the advantage of age in an institution that honors seniority. Ive learned patience when appropriate. And urgency when required. Ive learned the art of collecting political capital to be saved for when circumstances present an opportunity to invest in the big things. The things that matter most! Ive kept my commitment to stay close to the people of North Dakota. I listen carefully and I apply what I hear to the decisions I make. I share information and my values openly and then let the chips fall where they may. And whether a constituent agrees with me most of the time or disagrees with me most of the time Im always blessed by our mutual respect embodied in our open dialogue and transparency.

It wont matter if you live in a safe, blue state when it comes to reproductive rights. It wont matter if you live in a state that just fought to pass a ballot initiative protecting abortion rights. Thats what this election is coming down to. So Im going to pull on every lever to fight for the right to an abortion nationwide, like: *Relentlessly calling out MAGA Republicans extremism to defeat them at the ballot box and stop them from banning abortion nationwide. *Expanding our pro-abortion majority in the Senate and ending the filibuster so we can pass federal abortion protections. *Reversing the right-wing takeover of our Supreme Court by working to expand and rebalance it. *Continuing to support local candidates and ballot measures that will defend and organize for abortion rights at the state level. If it makes a difference for just one patient between now and the election, that would be enough. *Reminding everyone and their mother and their mothers mother and their father and their fathers best friend and their neighbors that abortion is on the ballot in 2024 and thats not just a campaign motto. Weve got to strengthen our pro-abortion movement ahead of the 2024 election. So if you chip in $25 or more right now, well send you a free Keep Abortion Legal pin to say thank you.

Like ensuring universal child care. Guaranteeing the right to an abortion nationwide. Passing a wealth tax to fund opportunities for all of our kids. But the GOP and special interests will fuel my opponents campaigns because they want to knock me and this team out of the game. And if Republicans take power, theyll work to prioritize giant corporations over working people. Ban abortion nationwide. Keep the rich from paying what they owe. This election is about two fundamentally different visions for our future. Two fundamentally different understandings of who our government should work for. Im in this fight to protect our freedoms, defend our democracy, and put Washington on the side of families but to win, weve got to keep growing our grassroots campaign. Before our next big FEC fundraising deadline on March 31, can you make a donation of $28 or any amount? Your support will help strengthen our re-election campaign, show how strong this team is, and enact policies that families will feel in their daily lives.

Its the same way we overcame the big banks to launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The same way we beat big manufacturers to lower the cost of hearing aids. The same way we defied high-priced lobbyists to pass my minimum tax on massive corporate profits. It comes down to this: staying in the fight by growing our grassroots movement together. We raise our voices to call out whats broken, we lay out our plans to fix it, and we fight side by side to make change. Grassroots donors make our movement possible, so I have to ask: if it makes sense for you right now, will you pitch in any amount to our re-election campaign before the March 31 FEC deadline?

In just a few weeks, well file an official report with the FEC on our fundraising for the last three months. The numbers will be public. The thing that makes this report so important and different from all of our previous reports is that this will be the first time we share our fundraising performance since a Republican opponent entered this race against me. Our opponent, his GOP supporters, special interests, Big Tech moguls, Wall Street executives, and far-right ideologues will scour our numbers for any signs of weakness. Not just because they want to defeat me for re-election but also because they want to prove that there isnt enough momentum for our progressive agenda. And if Republicans win more support and gain more power, theyd have more ability to pass their far-right agenda and block progress on the plans this movement is fighting for. I am fighting with everything Ive got to defeat their extremism and put power into the hands of working people. But I cant do it alone. A whole bunch of $3 donations add up fast to demonstrate widespread support for ending Washington corruption, ensuring the right to an abortion, guaranteeing universal child care, getting the wealthy to pay their fair share, tackling corporate price gouging, and making Washington work for working families.

Learn more about the IRSs free direct filing program and see if you qualify here and forward this email to anyone you know who also might be eligible. Remember, every year, when your W2s and 1099s come in the mail, your employer has already sent a copy to the government. Yep, they already know how much you make and owe before you file your taxes. Now, you may be used to filing your taxes with Intuits TurboTax and H&R Block. Theyre the ones who have lobbied against a free filing option. These giant tax prep companies have spent decades and tens of millions of dollars lobbying to make the tax-filing process as time-consuming and wallet-emptying as possible for taxpayers. All to pad their profits and prevent a free filing option. And its paid off for them. Americans spend an average of 9 hours and $150 a year filing their taxes. But when deciding to side with taxpayers or side with tax companies, Republicans have gone with this ones tough, are you on the edge of your seat? thats right, the companies. Theyve demanded that the IRS stop competing with private companies by offering a free option. (Please) These companies have also purposefully undermined their own free filing options that they do have hiding them from search engine results and using slick designs and upsell tactics to trick taxpayers into paying more. And because they just cant get enough, some companies have raked in even more by monetizing the private financial information taxpayers have been forced to share with them. So for years, I called on the IRS to establish a free tax filing tool in legislation, in hearings, in letters, you name it. And in 2022, Democrats were able to pass funding to make it happen! Republicans responded by protecting big tax prep companies and introducing a plan that would block this program, but we fought back and got this done. Im so happy to be sharing this news with you today. Visit directfile.irs.gov to see if youre eligible to use this free and easy filing option this year. This is just one way we can use the tools of government to work for working families. Im keeping up the fight to get even more done (tax the rich, anybody?).

While its not clear who Ill be up against, what is clear is that theyre pulling out all the stops to defeat me, and we cant underestimate this threat.

President Biden spoke about a lot of important issues during his address but I want to talk about one in particular. Its an issue that threads many, many issues together. Look, if you care about our climate, if you care about making heath care affordable, if you care about the future of our children, if you care about housing, if you care about expanding opportunity, then you have to care about our tax code. President Biden said it best: No billionaire in our country should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse. But our current tax system allows it and Donald Trump made sure of that. While in office, Trump passed a tax law that gave billionaires and wealthy corporations $2 trillion in tax breaks. Thats trillion with a T. Its one of his only substantial accomplishments as president. Our tax code allows the 1,000 billionaires in America to pay an average federal tax rate that's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. So President Biden has proposed a minimum tax of 25% for billionaires to right this wrong. But wait, theres more we cant forget about wealthy corporations, too. In 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes. Z-e-r-o. Congress started to tackle this by passing my bill to make billionaire corporations pay a minimum 15% of their profits in taxes. This produced enough money to cover all of the climate proposals in the Inflation Reduction Act. It was a strong start, and President Biden is taking it a step further, proposing we raise it to 21%. He also included his objective to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, and massive executive pay. These changes can help create affordable child care and paid family leave, fund our public schools and housing, invest in affordable housing and health care.the list goes on. Look, when we consider the two-trillion-dollar question of Who does our government work for? the answer is in our tax code. Do we want our government to work for rich and powerful people and companies to help make them more rich and more powerful? Or do we want our government to work for the middle class? I understand that conversations about the tax code can get wonky. I know that on its surface the tax code isnt the most invigorating issue. But like President Biden said, it boils down to a simple question of fairness. How can we get everyone to pay their fair share, and give everyone a fair shot? Good tax policy is good for every issue we want to tackle. And thats damn good politics. Ill keep doing everything in my power to make sure millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations are paying their fair share in taxes by championing President Biden, and fighting for my plans to pass a wealth tax on fortunes greater than $50 million and end lobbying as we know it so big money wont have so much power in Washington. Im able to stay in these fights because Im shoulder to shoulder with people like you. Can you help grow our grassroots campaign and support my re-election with a donation of $28 or any amount?

Now, you might be wondering why exactly a donation today is so important. Let me explain: Less than a month ago, a Republican challenger from Rhode Island entered the Massachusetts Senate race against me. That unlocks an opportunity for national Republicans, billionaires, and corporate interests to invest in getting me and the plans were fighting for out of office. The amount that we raise right now in response will determine how strong we can compete and how much we can invest in campaigning for our plans. We not only have to spend the next year fighting back against MAGA extremism but also against a system that benefits from the status quo and says that big change is impossible. Thats why Im running for re-election to stop MAGA extremism, build on the progress weve made so far in Massachusetts, and deliver the big, structural change our country still needs. Im talking with people across Massachusetts about the issues affecting their families and campaigning for bold policies that will transform the lives of working people across the country. Policies like creating affordable child care and housing. Holding big corporations accountable and bringing down costs. Reimagining our tax code and passing a wealth tax. But first, weve got to win this race and were competing against interests who want to put a stop to these policies. Special interests will look for any signs of weakness as they plan on where to invest in 2024. Thats why its incredibly important that we raise a competitive amount of grassroots contributions right now so we can run a strong campaign for our plans.

My guest will be a student loan borrower and teacher from Massachusetts who had her student debt canceled thanks to this teams organizing and thanks to President Bidens efforts to improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Ill be glad to celebrate and honor the progress President Biden has made on canceling student debt so far (nearly $138 billion in student debt has been canceled for almost 3.9 million borrowers through more than two dozen executive actions). But I want to know what youre hoping to hear about at the State of the Union, too. Whether its abortion access, student debt cancellation, the economy, our democracy, or international affairs, theres a lot to discuss as we gear up for this consequential election against Donald Trump.

TAKE SURVEY Heres the way I see it: when the American people see their elected officials making positive changes that touch their lives, theyre more likely to keep those leaders in office. So when we have President Bidens record in office compared to Trumps, heres what we see: *Donald Trump has done two big things: Imposed an extremist Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade, and passed a giant tax break that was mostly sucked up by millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations. *On the other hand, what does President Bidens record show? Well, he's got $35 insulin and Medicare drug price negotiations for the first time, canceling all that student loan debt, passing the biggest climate package in the history of the world (paid for by my 15% tax on billionaire corporations that this movement fought hard for), getting the IRS the resources it needs to create a free filing system target wealthy tax cheats. And a whole lot more. We know that if the GOP gains any more power in November, theyll work to pass their extremist agenda and actively reverse all the progress weve made together. So Im going to keep fighting with all Ive got to keep Joe Biden in the White House.

We cant let that happen.

Not their own pocketbooks. Not their future job prospects in the private sector. Not the wishes of big donors and giant corporations. The public interest. So Ive got a whole bunch of plans to root corruption out of Washington. Some are more specific, like my Department of Defense Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act, which would limit the influence of contractors on the military, constrain foreign influence on retired senior military officers, and require greater transparency from contractors in their interactions with the Pentagon. Or my Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act, which would strengthen ethical standards up and down our judiciary, impose an enforceable code of conduct on the Supreme Court, and ban federal judges from owning individual stock. Or my Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, which would require the president and vice president to disclose and divest from any potential financial conflicts of interest. Thats a standard that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have already cleared and that all their successors should be held to. Especially after we saw Donald Trump run the most corrupt administration in modern history. Or my bipartisan legislation to reform the Federal Reserve, which would bar big bank executives from serving on Reserve Bank boards of directors, subject directors to ethics and financial conflict of interest rules, and bring increased transparency and accountability to the Fed. And then Ive got my big plan: the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act. Its the most sweeping set of reforms since Watergate. And it would fundamentally change the way Washington does business, including *Banning all individual stock ownership by members of Congress, Cabinet secretaries, senior congressional staff, federal judges, White House staff, and other senior agency officials while in office. *Prohibiting all federal officials from holding or trading stock if its value might be influenced by their agency, department, or actions. *Tightening conflict of interest and recusal requirements. *Padlocking the revolving door between industry and government. *Creating a new, independent anti-corruption agency dedicated to enforcing federal ethics laws. *Expanding an independent and empowered Congressional ethics office. All of these plans have two things in common. Theyre about putting our government on the side of the people not the powerful special interests. And theyre only possible if we grow and strengthen our grassroots movement. Thats how we beat Big Money. Im running for re-election so we can root corruption out of Washington, rebuild our middle class, and strengthen our democracy. But I cant do it alone.

Lets talk about greedflation. You know it and I know it: giant corporations will seize any opportunity to pad their profits on the backs of working families. So its no surprise that theyve taken advantage of inflation and supply chain disruptions to jack up prices even higher than necessary to cover increased costs. And if theyre trying to keep their strategy hush-hush, theyre doing a lousy job: executives have flat-out admitted on public earnings calls that theyve raised prices faster than inflation for the sake of higher profits. Im fighting back by reintroducing my Price Gouging Prevention Act. Here are some big pieces of what my bill would do: *Prohibit price gouging at the federal level anytime and anywhere. *Target dominant companies that have exploited the pandemic to boost profits including companies that brag about increasing prices during periods of inflation. *Require public companies to clearly disclose costs and pricing strategies at certain times. *Provide additional funding to the FTC for enforcement. Sound good? Add your name to sign on as a grassroots co-sponsor of my Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2024, and lets work together to get it passed because working people shouldnt have to wince every time they look at their grocery store receipt. ADD YOUR NAME Price gouging certainly isnt a new trend. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, big corporations took advantage of the crisis to prey on consumers by price gouging, hiding behind inflation and supply chain disruptions to do it and were still paying the price. Even though corporations costs are coming down and profits are rising, prices remain high for hardworking Americans rising by 3.4 percent over the past year while producers input costs have only gone up by 1 percent. Take diapers: prices for wood pulp, the main input for diapers, declined by 25 percent last year, yet parents are still paying higher and higher prices for diapers. For many commodities and services, the cost of production has actually decreased. Meanwhile, unchecked consolidation across nearly all sectors of the economy has enabled dominant giants to boost prices with few consequences, disincentivizing new businesses and harming consumers. Im going to keep fighting back and its time to pass my bill to give the Biden-Harris administration, as well as state attorneys general, more tools to tackle corporate greed. Add your name if you agree that we need to crack down on corporate price gouging, and let me know youre ready to help make it happen.

As the New York Times reported, \"One thing Mr. Trump likes about a 16-week federal ban on abortions is that its a round number.\" So, were just picking numbers that feel fun. Got it. I like numbers too, so let me throw one out there: about a year after Trumps Supreme Court justices helped overturn Roe, 61 percent of Americans said they disagreed with that ruling. In fact, most people in our country want to see individuals and their doctors making decisions about abortion, not extremist politicians. Another thing: Media outlets claimed this was Trumps attempt to \"move to the center\" on abortion ahead of the general election. I just need to make this loud and clear: A national abortion ban that would take away a right that women now have in 23 states is not \"moving to the center\" on abortion rights. Its continuing to swerve way over to the right. Its no secret that Donald Trump is an anti-abortion extremist. Any other description is a dangerous mischaracterization. So can you please split a contribution between the Biden-Harris campaign and our re-election campaign to strengthen our abortion rights movement and prevent MAGA extremists from passing a national ban? DONATE NOW: $3: DONATE NOW: $15: DONATE NOW: $28: DONATE NOW: $50: DONATE NOW: $100: OTHER AMOUNT: The vast majority of Americans agree that the government shouldnt interfere with peoples personal decisions on abortion. The GOP and anti-abortion extremists know this, so they worked for years to force their unpopular agenda through hijacking the courts. But now that theyve gotten their wish and overturned Roe v. Wade, voters have been fighting back. In election after election ever since in Kansas, in Michigan, in Ohio, and in Virginia they keep reminding anti-abortion extremists how out of touch they really are. Now the GOP is attempting to soften and message-test their anti-abortion stances ahead of the 2024 election. Theyre afraid of sounding too extreme. But heres Donald Trumps extreme anti-abortion record: *He appointed anti-choice Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade *Hes boasted about being the president who got rid of Roe v. Wade *He supports a national ban *He said there has to be \"some form of punishment\" for women who get abortions I wont stop calling out the GOPs extremism and fighting for the right to an abortion nationwide. That means electing pro-choice Democrats and ending the filibuster so we can codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. That means reversing right-wing takeover of our Supreme Court by working to expand and rebalance it. And that means supporting local candidates and ballot measures that will defend abortion rights at the state level. Wherever you are in America, if you care about abortion rights, if you care about protecting the right of people to have access to abortion, understand this: Donald Trump and the Republicans are coming for you even if you live in a \"safe\" state right now. Thats why its so critical that we keep the White House and maintain our Senate majority. So please split a donation of $28 between my re-election and the Biden-Harris campaign so we can push back against MAGA Republicans\\' out-of-touch extremism and pass national abortion protections.

A big corporate merger that would make our financial system less stable, reduce competition, and increase fees and credit costs for American families. Im talking about the recently proposed merger of two credit card giants, Capital One and Discover. This Wall Street deal is dangerous. It would harm working people. And Im calling on regulators to block it immediately. Add your name if you agree, and say youre in this fight for a more competitive economy that works for families, not giant corporations. All over our economy, we see the painful consequences of corporate giants being allowed to gobble up other corporate giants. From the airline industry to grocery stores to agribusinesses to Big Tech to Ticketmaster, a smaller number of giants have gained more and more power, and theyve used that power to stomp on workers and consumers. Once they control a bigger piece of the pie, they can control things like pricing without any fear that their customers would go across the street for a cheaper price because they own both sides of the street. The fewer firms in an industry, the easier it is for them to collude and fix prices. Why did we end up here? Heres a big reason: for decades, regulators took their hands off the wheel and allowed corporate concentration to reach extreme heights. Ive introduced legislation to help stomp out rampant corporate consolidation. And Ive called on federal agencies to use all their tools to challenge big, harmful corporate mergers mergers that can lead to lower wages, higher prices, worse service, and a less competitive economy. But I cant get this done all by myself we fight side by side as a grassroots movement.

From the time they were teenage sweethearts, my daddy bought my mother a heart-shaped box of chocolates every year. I still have a box of valentines that he gave her all those years ago. I loved celebrating my mother\\'s birthday and Valentine\\'s Day as a double-feature. When I was a little girl, I bought some heart-shaped pans at the dime store. It became a family tradition: Every year, I baked my mother a heart-shaped cake. Decades later, when she was in her 80s, she had some minor surgery nothing serious. The day before she was scheduled to go home, she was in good cheer. All the kids and grandkids came to visit, and we gathered in her hospital room to tell funny stories. We laughed and had juice and cookies. Finally, Daddy sent us all home, and we left that evening expecting her to be released from the hospital the next day. Then, in the middle of the night, my brother called. He said that our mother was dead. Daddy had been sitting with her when she leaned forward and said, \"Don, there\\'s that gas pain again.\" Then she died. I was almost too shocked to cry. I just couldn\\'t believe it. How could this have happened? The autopsy showed that she had advanced heart disease never diagnosed and never treated. Despite her regular trips to the doctor for check-ups and repeated trips for \"that gas pain,\" she had never been checked for heart trouble. No one had any idea. Later, I would learn that heart disease is the #1 killer of women. It was considered a mans disease, but doctors do a much better job screening and treating women for it now than when my mother had her heart attack. Even though my mother is gone now, I still have my heart-shaped pans. This week, I baked a heart-shaped cake, and opened up the box filled with old valentines from my daddy. Its how I remember her. A photo of Senator Warren with a heart shaped cake And Im also doing something more: Im fighting with every bone in my body to make sure everyone can get the health care they need to live long, healthy lives with the people they love. So you know Im staying in the fight to protect Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, no matter how hard Republican extremists attack them. Health care is a basic human right. And we fight for basic human rights. I also want to make a pitch for one more program: Medicaid. Millions of Americans with a history of heart disease, stroke, or other cardiovascular diseases rely on Medicaid as their safety net. Look, we dont know whose baby is going to be born with a hole in her heart and run up $1 million in medical bills in the first few months. We dont know whose grandma is going to have a massive stroke and need to go into a nursing home. But what we do know is that as Americans, we all pitch in some nickels so that if it happens to your family, the rest of us will all be there. Im in this fight for Medicaid all the way.

One of my least favorites, though? Intuit TurboTax spent millions to run another Super Bowl ad bragging about how their product makes it fast and easy to file your taxes. But they failed to mention one big piece of information: Theyve also spent millions of dollars lobbying to make the tax-filing process as difficult and time-consuming as possible. All to create more demand for their product. All to pad their profits. And all at the expense of Americans who spend an average of $240 and 13 hours to file their taxes every year. As if that isnt bad enough, Intuit has also tricked low-income Americans who are eligible for free filing services into paying for its companys products. And you know what? Intuit legally cant advertise TurboTax as free anymore because of all the junk fees theyve sprung on taxpayers. So that Super Bowl ad should have come with a big disclaimer at the end in gigantic print: This commercial has been subsidized by all the taxpayers who paid for a service that should have been free. But theres good news: the IRS is piloting a truly free Direct File program, starting this tax season. Sure enough, though, tax prep giants like Intuit are lobbying to stop this solution in its tracks. To get free tax filing across the finish line, Washington needs to hear from the American people. If youre sick and tired of seeing these expensive ads from tax prep giants, add your name to say you agree it should be quick and easy to file your taxes without having to turn to a private company. ADD YOUR NAME For years and years, Ive called out giant tax prep corporations for lobbying to keep it an expensive hassle to file your taxes. Ive urged the IRS to make free filing a reality in legislation, in hearings, in letters, in explainers, you name it. And I havent been alone. People like you have raised your voices, too in petitions, on social media, in messages to elected officials, and more. Two years ago, Democrats included funding for free tax filing in the Inflation Reduction Act, along with support for the IRS to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. And starting this year, the pilot program is getting off the ground. Im going to stay on this and make sure Americans dont have to waste time and money with big tax prep corporations.

Some of Donald Trumps allies have been hyping this conspiracy theory, to which I had this to say: haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Obviously, their idea is absurd. But this is a symptom of a very real illness within the MAGA Republican and Fox News ecosystem that replaces reality with conspiracy. They also spread theories like *A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Hillary Clinton, or Michelle Obama, or Barack Obama people who are not Joe Biden. *Theres a war on Christmas. And masculinity. *The idea that countless abortion patients are getting late-term abortions in fact only a tiny fraction of abortions take place after 21 weeks or later and the reasons are heartbreaking. *LGBTQIA+ educators, or educators who acknowledge LGBTQIA+ rights, are somehow indoctrinating students with a hidden agenda. *Climate change is a hoax. *Even if it isnt a hoax, fossil fuel companies have nothing to do with it. *If an election yields results that you dont agree with, it must be because of voter fraud and not because you lost. *Related, they believe Donald Trump won re-election. I could unfortunately go on and on, but you get the point. Trumps GOP is out of touch and out of control and its being enabled by right-wing media. Theyre intending to confuse and scare people in exchange for power, and we have to call it out like it is.

From Doritos to Oreos to toilet paper and beyond, big corporations have been cutting down on how much they put in a bag, in a box, or on a roll without cutting their prices. In fact, they sometimes charge MORE. For less. Its called shrinkflation. Corporate executives thought we wouldnt notice, but they were wrong. We caught on. And were not buying their excuse that its all about inflation. Why? Because corporate profits have increased by a whopping 75% over the past few years, outrunning inflation by miles. Shrinkflation is just another way for giant corporations to pad their profits and leave us with the crumbs. Literally. Its greed, pure and simple. We need to call it out and we need to push back against corporate abuses of power. In Washington, Im working to combat price gouging, break up big monopolies that stifle competition and lead to higher prices, eliminate junk fees that can suck hundreds of dollars a month out of peoples pockets, and make our economy work for working people not just CEOs who spend their days scheming about how to make more money by doing less.

New POLITICO reporting has detailed how these groups advise leveraging new rules at agencies like the FTC, FDA, and EPA, as well as using executive orders to slash abortion access nationwide without needing to receive Congressional approval. Theyre calling it the Heritage Foundations 2025 Presidential Transition Project. Its almost 1,000 pages long, and its authors include members of the first Trump administration, Students for Life, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and other anti-abortion organizations. Theyre also collecting resumes from conservative activists who are interested in becoming political appointees of these agencies to carry out these new anti-abortion measures themselves. This will enable the Trump administration to have everything and everyone it needs to carry out its goal of rescinding abortion rights everywhere nationwide no matter where you live. As these groups work on their plan, Ive got a plan too. To fight like hell to keep Trump out of the White House, work to re-elect President Biden, flip the House, and expand the Senate with more pro-choice Democrats. That way, well have the votes we need to codify abortion rights into federal law.

Can you chip in to help us finish this End of Quarter strong and hold our own against campaigns backed by wealthy donors? >> As you know, this is going to be a very competitive race. Many challengers are joining to try to keep this seat under GOP control, and some of their campaigns have already \"hit the high notes\" when it comes to out-of-touch rhetoric. Unfortunately, its a lot easier for them to push divisiveness than to address the real problems that we\\'re facing here in Utah. Real problems such as: 1the health of our environment and coal\\'s impact on it, 2our economy and a need for affordable housing and better paying jobs for working families, 3our broken healthcare system that puts access and affordability out of reach for too many Utahns, and 4government overreach into our most important decisions, endangering reproductive rights. Friend, this movement is backed by thousands of hard-working Utahns who are tired of political games and inaction.

I'm proud to have some of the fastest times on a few segments, but what I enjoy the most is being able to see all the adventures my friends are on! Just like on Strava, a political campaign needs to maintain a good pace. While my friends and I can track our progress on our physical goals on Strava, grassroots movements like ours track progress with how much we can fundraise. Can you chip in to join us on this climb and help us turn Utah blue? >> This is Mitt Romney's old seat and we know that many Utahns want a Senator who cares about the people, not scoring political points and maximizing corporate profits. Our movement has brought together folks from both sides of the aisle. Whether they feel disillusioned by their current party leadership or left out of politics, we are here for them. Friend, we can't do this alone. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and fight for Utah in the Senate. Will you join us by contributing whatever you can to our campaign today?

Recent attacks on IVF (in vitro fertilization) and the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos can be treated as children have put many people in a tough spot. Once again, the government is trying to insert itself into our personal lives, and elected officials are using the unborn and would-be families in their attempts to further their control and impose their ideology on others. Before I ask you to support my people-powered campaign with a donation today, I'd like to tell you about my story with the IVF process. When I was 36 I decided to freeze my eggs for the option to have children in the future. It was a decision that I was so thankful to be able to make and it gave me a perspective into many folks' journey to starting a family. This technology gives many people hope, freedom, and opportunity, but continued attacks on reproductive rights are putting that all at risk. Instead of focusing on issues that affect us every day like lowering the cost of living and addressing the inaccessibility of housing and childcare, would-be families and bodily autonomy are being attacked. Friend, I will never stop fighting for reproductive rights including the opportunity for every Utahn to start a family, how and when they want to. We're answering the call for a new generation of leaders and our run for Senate needs your help. Can you join our movement by chipping in whatever you can today?

[SIGN OUR PETITION] Thank you, Team Caroline Gleich\",\n  \"Friend let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm Caroline Gleich, the Democrat running for Mitt Romney's open seat. Like many people, my political journey began years ago. I love the outdoors, so when I kept hearing about misguided policies and actions which were written in favor of corporations instead of people, I knew something had to be done. The problem was I didn't think my voice mattered. Since then, I have come to see that political involvement really is a civic duty and that every single person can have an impact. Friend, our campaign has the support of a broad coalition of Utahns fed up with the inaction of today's divided political system. Can you chip in what you can today to help us create real change for Utah in the Senate? FIRST: I completed a political internship for Ted Wilson, who was the environmental advisor to Governor Gary Herbert. I also tested my limits by pushing myself physically, being the first woman to finish Andrew McLean's Chuting Gallery - a steep guidebook to 90 of Utah's hardest ski lines. THEN: I testified before the Senate Special Committee on the Climate Crisis, I summited and skied Cho Oyu and summited Mt. Everest with a torn ACL. I then testified before the House Committee on Natural Resources and was honored as Utah Clean Energy's Climate Champion of the year. I also skied with Senator Martin Heinrich to advocate for clean energy legislation, and hosted the Run to Redistrict - leading a group run through all four of Utah's Congressional Districts in 1.5 miles to highlight their partisan gerrymandering. NOW: Our grassroots movement of Utahns is taking on the challenge of fighting for real change. My past experience has shown me that nothing is impossible and that Utahns from Salt Lake City to St. George just want their voices heard. It's time for a new generation of leaders in the Senate. Friend, will you join our movement by contributing whatever you can to our campaign today? We need your help to get our message out to folks across the state. Can you chip in $15, $35 or $50 today?

Before I humbly ask you to support our campaign with a donation today, I wanted to talk about tonight's event. Tonight is President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, the last one before the election this November. A key aspect of our campaign is to acknowledge the need for collaboration with our federal government and to work alongside them to accomplish tasks that are too big for us to tackle on our own. We have common goals, and we can't let party politics come in the way of meeting them. Help should always be welcome, never shunned away. With that said, there are some things I will be hoping to hear addressed at this State of the Union; reproductive rights, the existential crisis that is climate change, the economic wellbeing of our communities, and rising healthcare costs. These issues are not only important to our country, but especially to Utahns. Friend, in spite of the political partisanship that so often acts as a wedge between Utahns, one thing that brings us all together is the hope for a better life. One where our government acts in our best interests and serves the people. I have hope, and I am excited to be a part of this movement.

I am constantly blown away by the support behind our campaign, and I could not be more grateful. Today is the Presidential Primary in Utah, and downballot races that affect everyday Utahns are influenced by the party leadership's view on politics. Republicans in Utah have capitulated to the more extreme wing of their party for years, and our position today reflects that. We need to start working together to deal with issues that affect both Utahns and Americans. For me, bipartisanship isn't just some buzzword. I mean it when I say that we are in dire need of solutions and that we can only do this together. Trump's enabling of extreme right wing policies doesnt help anyone and only acts as a distraction from solving the real problems facing our country.

He passed away in an avalanche on Stairs Gulch when I was 15. I felt a hole in my heart a hole that remains there to this day. In what became a turning point in my life, I learned that we can't shy away from adversity and tough challenges.

Dave Min, a state Senator who currently represents 80% of the congressional district, just advanced out of last weeks primary and now will face Republican Scott Baughthe same corrupt, extremist Republican I won against in 2022. Ive endorsed Dave Min because CA-47 deserves to be represented by a progressive Democrat for years to come. Dave has done important work at the state level to improve the lives of Orange County families. He ended gun shows on California state property, has fought to end offshore oil drilling, passed critical protections for domestic violence survivors, and delivered billions of dollars in COVID-19 relief funds to small businesses. Hes proven he can win in Orange County while delivering a progressive agenda. This is one of the countrys most important House races. Republicans hold a tiny majority in the House, and so holding every competitive seat like this one is critical. Anything you can give will help us ensure CA-47 stays blue.

I want to thank each and every one of you for the support you have shown over the years. I never even considered running for office until Trump was elected. To me, that was for people who were more polished who had more perfect lives. People of a certain pedigree. But someone close to me said, as a woman, if you wait your turn, you wont get one. And what I found out over the last 6 years is that by and large it's truethere aren't a lot of people in Congress who are single moms; there arent many of us who live paycheck to paycheck; who go to the grocery store and understand how much a pack of bologna costs. Americans are hungry for leaders who break the mold. We want honest leaders who are willing to call things like they see them. We want elected officials who will deliver truth to power and exact real accountability from big corporations and government bureaucrats. We want leaders who demand better from both parties who want PROGRESS, not partisanship. Leaders whose bottom line is people, not profits. That's why WE were able to turn heads in this campaign and make the people in power listen. Let's be honest: I think all of us can agree, our government isn't working well for us. So many of those in power are too interested in helping other powerful people than paying attention to the needs of everyday people. They are more interested in BEING an elected official than actually DOING anything to fix the problems everyday people face. It's why billionaires fought so hard to keep me out of the Senate. Special interests and the ultra wealthy like politics as it is today because they control the politicians. And, like weve seen in this campaign, they spend millions to defeat someone who will dilute their influence and disrupt the status quo. Because of you, we had the establishment running scared withstanding 3 to 1 in TV spending, an onslaught of billionaires spending millions peddling lies, and our opponents spending more to boost the Republican than promoting his own campaign. I've met so many people over the course of this race who tell me that they feel like their voices arent being heard by those who have the power. Ill never stop fighting for all of those people.

In the Senate Ill build on my legislation that raised federal rates on polluters for the first time in a century. You can read more about these plans at katieporter.com/plans. *If I dont advance to the general election, Republican celebrity candidate Steve Garvey will, and thats bad news for Democrats down-ballot come November. Steve Garveys candidacy is already juicing conservative turnout throughout the state.

Their super PAC has spent millions more, with ads from both airing on Fox News constantly. Garvey has risen in the polls, despite not running a single TV ad of his own or taking any sort of real policy position in our debates. In polls, hes now consistently tied with Katie or slightly ahead. This cynical play to boost a Republican into the top two may work to further Schiffs own career, but it threatens to box out qualified Democratic women (and leave CA without a woman Senator for the first time in over thirty years). As reporters have said, If Schiff succeeds in juicing Republican turnout for Garvey, it stands to reason that those Republicans will also vote Republican down the ballot. Garvey himself has no shot of winning, but there may well be closer races in purple House and state legislative districts, school boards, and more that could be swung by a surge in Republican turnout that Schiff is spending millions to stoke. This is a dangerous play that has national implications. Republicans hold the House majority by just a few seats, and several flippable districts are here in California. If our state has a competitive Democrat on Democrat contest in November, it will encourage Democratic voters to tune in and show up. But a Republican on Democrat race for Senate here in California threatens to depress Democratic turnout, as folks know this is a safe blue seat. Career politicians shouldnt get to manipulate the electorate and buy themselves a promotion. There are just five days until the election, and we are doing everything we can to beat Republican Steve Garvey and make it into the general election, where we know Katie has a strong chance of winning.

The second, conducted later when voters had more time to see our ads, showed us one point ahead of Garvey and in second place. These polls also show that large margins of votersnearly 20% are still undecided about who to support. So while this forward movement is a promising sign, Schiff saw the exact same poll.

Both Schiff and his super PAC are spending heavily on Fox News to propel Garvey into second place, despite Schiffs previous calls for advertisers to boycott the network. To be frank, Schiff and the super PACs supporting him are just drowning us out. As of yesterday, he reportedly spent $22.3 million on advertising in the past six weeks, has twice as much cash on hand as us, and is outspending us three to one on TV.

Schiffs support is highest among voters in their 60s, at 45%, and those over 70, with 39%, whereas Porters strength is among young voters, where she holds 23%. Notably, this group has the highest share of undecided voters at 28%. Garveys strength is also with older voters, with 33% support among voters over 70. I dont always feel young, especially when my kids call my social media cringe. But were winning over younger voterspeople in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s, because younger Californians are often most concerned they wont be able to afford to live here and raise families hereand they know we have to shake up Washington to actually address the problem. When I visited with students at UC Davis, I asked how many of them thought they could ever afford to buy a home here in California, and not a single student raised their hand. But especially in primaries, younger people vote at lower rates than older voters. And as the polling shows, younger voters who are currently uncommitted to a candidate will be key to our victory. We have to put serious effort into turning out and persuading millennial and Gen Z voters. With just 13 days to the primary, is there anything you can give to help us reach younger voters? Donate This isnt just about my race. Young people are losing faith in our democracy and in our party. As Democrats, we need to show young voters that our government can work for them. That means having elected officials who are responsive and represent their voters, not special interests. It means having an economy that actually works for working people. And it means successfully communicating when we pass meaningful legislationits my job as an elected official to tell my constituents how I can helpnot the other way around!

Our final debate is tonight at 6 PM, and Ill be honestIm nervous. If youve watched any of the past two debates, youve seen celebrity Republican Steve Garvey refuse to take any real policy positionhe wont even tell voters if he plans to support Donald Trump or not. But even after his poor performance, polls show us narrowly trailing Garveyfor the second place spot in this race. Second place is a big deal, because the top two finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election in November. So how do we pull ahead? Its a question Im asking myself everyday. The problem is that the leading candidate in this race, Adam Schiff, is outspending us every single day. Hes running $10 million worth of ads that actually *boost* Republican Steve Garvey, in an attempt to box us out of the general. On top of that, Schiffs super PAC and a separate crypto super PAC are placing new ad buys every few days, spending several million against us. The ads these super PACs are running are not just misleading voters, theyre straight up lying about my record. Billionaires, establishment politicians, and corporate special interests are trying to buy this race, and it looks like their plan might work.

Yesterday was a busy day, with a rally in Long Beach followed by a candidate forum hosted by Univision in LA. With just 16 days until the election, every day and every dollar counts. I have to be honest, this last week has been tough. On Tuesday, a crypto super PAC funded by a handful of billionaires spent $3.6 million on attack ads. That ad buy came just days after Schiffs super PAC spent several million against us. The Schiff campaign alone spent more on Facebook advertising last week than the Biden campaigntheyre spending and raising at record-high levels, and Ill be bluntwere not able to keep up. Recent polls show that between 20-30% of voters are undecided about who theyll support in this race, and the results will likely come down to just a few percentage points. That means every additional digital ad we can get eyeballs on, every additional event we can host, and every extra 30 seconds worth of TV ads we can secure could make all the difference. Im at real risk of losing, which would mean Im out of Congress for good.

It never even mentions Schiffits a clear play to consolidate conservative support behind Steve Garvey and launch him into second place. Can you pitch in right now to help us fight back? Donate Im just not one for BS, and thats what this ad is. It falsely tells voters that Steve Garvey could win the race entirely and tilt the balance of the Senate. But a Republican hasnt won a US Senate election in California since 1988. The LA Times reports that the Schiff super PAC is funded by wealthy individuals who can give unlimited donations. And Adam Schiff himself has taken corporate PAC and lobbyist money for decades, stockpiling more cash than any other Democrat. We cant just give up because he has more money and more power. Polls still show an incredibly close race that will be decided by just a few percentage points. Is there anything you can give today to help me pull ahead?

Then: He started sending mail to Republican voters encouraging them to vote for Republican Steve Garvey. Now: A Slate article says this sneaky campaign tactic is a danger to all Democrats not named Adam Schiff. Heres what else the article says: *Schiffs campaign is working tirelessly on [Garveys] behalf, effectively running the Garvey campaign by proxy. *Alls fair in politics, but its still a little surprising and more than a little cynical that the man who raised millions from Democrats after his censure vote for fighting back against the MAGA base, in his own words, is now using those very same millions to elevate the political prospects of a Trump-voting Republican. In other words, Schiff is now using his coffers to fight for the MAGA base. And not only in this race. *Although this plan might work out for Schiff personally, there are plenty of downside risks for Democrats elsewhere. If Schiff succeeds in juicing Republican turnout for Garvey, it stands to reason that those Republicans will also vote Republican down the ballot. Garvey himself has no shot of winning, but there may well be closer races in purple House and state legislative districts, school boards, and more that could be swung by a surge in Republican turnout that Schiff is spending millions to stoke. *Purely as a matter of small-D democratic representation, this runoff ought to be a rare opportunity for the states supermajority to express its preference.

Working in campaign finance usually means long days of call time with a candidate, where a politician spends hours dialing for dollars. Usually, candidates are asking for checks of $5,000 or more per person, and oftentimes lobbyists and corporate PACs are first on the call list. Because Katie doesnt take corporate PAC or federal lobbyist money, we do things differently. 85% of our fundraising comes from our online fundraising programwhich includes emails like these, texts, and ads that ask people to contribute, and 99% of all our contributions are of $100 or less. Thats something were proud of (and Katie is leading the way for other candidates to do the same). But theres a real downside to running a grassroots-funded campaign: it can be volatile. Just take a look at our ActBlue this week: [IMG]Our fundraising really fluctuates based on the news cycle and how supporters respond to our messaging. But with just 26 days until our primary, we really cant afford these slow days. They have a real and immediate effect at this point in the racebad days mean we have to scale back our ads.

Housing is the top issue for Californians, but career politicians in Washington have been too slow to provide solutions. I saw this firsthand as a consumer protection attorney on the front lines of the foreclosure crisis, and now as a parent who doesnt want my kids to leave California just because they cant afford to live here. My Housing for All plan is belowif youd prefer to watch me break it down on my whiteboard, click here. 1.Create a Select Committee on Housing: Despite a decades-long housing crisis, Congress has no committee solely focused on increasing housing and reducing costs. Ill create and lead a committee that delivers the housing solutions that Californias communities and families need, not just what boosts Wall Streets profits. 2.Urgently increase the supply of homes for purchase: Its virtually impossible to develop starter homes profitably and at scale, so Ill push for improved tax credits and government loan guarantees, which will spur Wall Street to provide financing for homes that working people can actually afford. 3.Washington must close the housing gap for low-income families: High costs push people into homelessness or housing instability. We should fully fund housing rental vouchers for the most severely housing-burdened families. To address the wealth inequalities that limit first-time homeowners, particularly people of color, we should make a federal investment in tools like down payment assistance and interest rate buy-downs. 4.Unleash private capital for home construction: In the 1930s, Congress established government-sponsored enterprises (today known as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae) to connect Wall Street capital to everyday Americans, who previously could not get mortgages. The result was a rocketing homeownership rate. We should expand these structures to guarantee the construction of one-to-four unit starter homes. With strong oversight, these agencies can tap into global capital markets to scale up the construction of modest-density homes that working people can afford to buy. 5.Break down local barriers: Solving the housing crisis requires all levels of government to engage. Ill give incentives to communities that make it cheaper to build all the kinds of housing Californians need. Costs go up when cities require certain home styles or building materials, or impose oppressive rules like mandatory parking requirements. 6.Unlock government land: Ill press federal, state, and local agencies to release large swaths of buildable land that they own. 7.Encourage innovative homebuyer programs: Innovative mortgage lending programs can stop house prices from spiraling out of control. Ill make it easier to form land trusts, in which communities and homebuyers share in the value of home appreciation. The land trusts share of the appreciation is then used to lower entry costs for future homeowners in the development, creating a virtuous cycle of affordable homeownership for the future. 8.Develop leases for Californians with fixed incomes: Ill support new kinds of leases that help Californians who arent served well by traditional rental agreements. Seniors should be able to put down a small portion of their retirement savings in exchange for locking in long-term rental rates that dont outpace Social Securitys cost of living adjustments. We should also develop a government-backed program for four-year leases that allow college students to lock in rental costs during their time in college. 9.Invest in modern home manufacturing technologies: We have been manufacturing homes the same way for decades. Ill make it easier for builders to develop and use the latest manufacturing techniques, like 3-D printed homes, which can reduce the cost of producing homes by 30% or more, and create high-paying, union jobs. These modern techniques are energy-efficient and use climate-resilient materials. 10.Protect homebuyers from Wall Street greed: Increasingly, Wall Street firms are buying up houses, driving up rental prices and preventing families from buying a home. Ill tax firms that buy up large numbers of homes so that we put an end to this trend. Can you please be one of the first people to endorse this plan? Endorse Katies Housing For All Plan Ive made housing the top issue of my campaign since day one because Californians cant wait any longer. Washington must act, and Ill lead the fight to get this done. Im so grateful to have you on our team. Katie Porter P.S.

Early polling suggests that I am in a very strong position to win the general election, no matter the other candidate, but the math in this primary is weird. A celebrity Republican is gaining traction in the polls, and he could advance to second place and keep us from qualifying for the general election. Election Day is less than five weeks away, but Californians begin voting even sooner. Ballots get mailed out next week, and with 20% of voters undecided, theres no time to waste. Just a single adwhether on TV or onlinecan change a voter's mind or inspire them to get their ballot in. The race between first, second, and third place will likely be decided by just a few percentage points.

Was it supply chains, interrupted by war and the pandemic? Greedy corporations? Washingtons failure to act? All three played a role. And I was deeply disappointed that the Senate never even bothered to vote on my bill that would have made price-gouging by oil companies illegal. But in fall of 2022, armed with lots of data, I used a Congressional Hearing to get answers from an economist who confirmed what I saw the numbers pointing to: record, rising corporate profits were accounting for at least half of the higher prices consumers were paying. [IMG] Big corporations still are trying to play the victim heresaying theyre just passing on higher costs to customers. But oftentimes, thats BS. From July through September 2023, the most recent period we have data for, corporate profits were just shy of the record peak they reached in 2022. Collectively, big corporations are making more than a *trillion* dollars more every three months than they were in 2017. Its on Congress to rein in these corporations. Too many billionaires are getting richer while more and more families cant afford rent. And thats exactly why Im running for the U.S. Senate. Im the only Democrat in this race who has never taken a dime from corporate PACs, but now Im being outspent by my opponent who has taken these checks for decades.

Those were the words I heard in late 2007 after presenting my research showing 70% of lenders were trying to collect more money than homeowners believed they owed. Back up for a second: In 2007 I was a law professor researching whether banks were taking advantage of homeowners by claiming Americans owed more than they really did. In a sample of 1,700 cases, I found banks were asking people to pay $6 million more than they expected. Banks repeatedly didnt have the documentation to back up their claims, and nobody in the system was willing or able to stop them. For so many families that meant losing their home entirely. It was a Wells Fargo lawyer who stood up after I presented my findings at a conference and lectured me on how the vast teams at Wells Fargo could afford to follow the law, and plenty of other Big Bank lawyers chimed in. The conventional wisdom was that banks were always right, and nobody needed to question it. If banks dont make mistakes, the next logical conclusion was that this was in fact a deliberate strategy to break the rules and cheat borrowers. Because of this research, a few months later I was asked to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Senator Chuck Schumer came prepared with a poster board, and pointed out how Wall Street boasted their strategy of foreclosure and late fees helped them become even more profitable. I left that hearing thinking punishment was coming for those lawbreaking banks, but for the most part they continued to collect every penny without following every rule. As a professor, I could study and point out problems. But I wanted to do more to actually change our system. Im running for the U.S. Senate to fight for the people who have been taken advantage of by big corporations and are struggling to get ahead. Thats the work Ive always done, and with your support I can head back to the Senatethis time with the power to hold Wall Street to account.I'd be so appreciative of anything you can chip in before 1/31 to help us meet our January fundraising goal and power our campaign.

Im not excluded from that statement. But what we should ask every single candidate, every day, is what they will do with that power. Prior to Trump being elected, I never considered running for office. I didnt work my way up to Congress or serve in student government. I was a law professor and consumer protection advocate who studied and saw how big corporations were cheating the rest of us. When I first ran for office in 2018, I was (and still am!) a single mom of three school age kids who drives a minivan. Now, Im running for the U.S. Senate because I want the power to go after the corrupt special interests that are making it difficult for families to get ahead. Oil companies need to be held accountable for their messes. Health insurance and pharmaceutical companies need to be held accountable for breaking laws, and for lobbying for a healthcare system that exists to serve their bottom lines. And corporations and the ultra-wealthy need to be held accountable when they cheat on their taxes. Our current system is not good enough, and its not going to be good enough to just go back to the way things were before Donald Trump.

In 2021, the Biden White House perpetrated a horrific, humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan resulting in the death of eleven U.S. Marines, a Navy Medical Corpsmen and a U.S. Army soldier. Though Hung Cao never sought any credit, he devoted months of his recent retirement from the U.S. Navy, in a quiet, uncompensated, 24/7 effort to help rescue American citizens, allies and brave interpreters who were abandoned by Mr. Bidens catastrophic capitulation in Afghanistan. Hung Cao wont run from a fight. He never has. He never will. Though possessed of true humility, he wont play it safe or deliver meaningless speeches or strive to be politically correct. What Hung Cao will do is boldly employ his God-given gifts of faith, courage, experience and wisdom to become a leader in the U.S. Senate. We, our children and grand-children deserve to have Hung Cao, an American Hero, a man of faith, integrity, and proven courage in mortal combat, representing us and our values in the U.S. Senate.Thats why I am officially endorsing Hung for the Senate and asking you to join me in endorsing him today >> < STAND WITH HUNG CAO < When Hillary Clinton ran for President her hand-picked Vice Presidential candidate, a professional politician and liberal activist, is now Hung Caos opponent here in Virginia.

Hung Cao is the most relevant person to address our present national crises.

But in the same breath, they warn that as the clear frontrunner, I bring to the table qualities where he lacks: diplomacy and national defense. It\\'s a funny because Kaine has been riding everyones coat tails his entire career, so he and Biden depending on each other is like watching a dog chasing his own tail. They are two goofy guy banking on failed policies that led to economic decline, higher prices at the grocery store and gas pumps, an invasion at the Southern Border and two wars. This November, we have an opportunity to put an end to the disastrous Biden-Kaine administration once and for all. Tim Kaine has been a U.S. Senator for more than a decade, and the only thing anyone remembers is that he got stuck on I-95 in a snowstorm with a bottle of Dr. Pepper. If we want to save our country, we need real leaders who are people of action - not politicians and bureaucrats. - CAPT Hung Cao USN (Ret) In Case You Missed It Dick Heller Endorses Hung Cao for Senate < Last week, Hung Cao received the endorsement of Dick Heller, who bravely fought for his 2nd Amendment rights in the U.S. Supreme Court caseDistrict of Columbia v.

Following his endorsement, Hung stated: \"Now more than ever, we see how important it is to have our 2nd Amendment rights.

Thats why I can tell you with 100% certainty that CAPT Hung Cao is the ONLY candidate in Virginia who can beat Tim Kaine and take back the Senate. Hung is the only person in this race who isnt a career politician. He didn't spend his life sitting at a desk and taking three-martini lunches with lobbyists -Hung spent 25 years fighting for our country as a U.S. Navy Captain. He took on terrorists face to face and risked his life to defend our country. Ive talked to so many voters during the course of this campaign, and I always hear the same thing: theyre sick and tired of business as usual in Washington.

But today, we have tens of thousands of illegal aliens from all over the world, entering our country every day. Syria. Iran. China. Yemen. Haiti. Nigeria. They are military-aged men who hate America. The Biden-Kaine Democrats are doing nothing to stop the flow. In fact, their open border policies serve as a Welcome to America sign, and heres their endgame: They want illegal immigrants to vote. They know theyll vote Democrat. And thats their ticket to a permanent majority and the unchecked control and power they crave. Heres my message to those who wish to come to the United States: Dont ask for the American Dream if you dont embrace the American laws and the American culture I DID. Friend, your contribution is hard at work taking our message across the Commonwealth. With less than 10 months until our Election Day showdown with career politician Tim Kaine, we need to up our game, and your continued support is urgently needed to bring home our victory. Heres our goal: Raise $30,000 in just 8 days. Can I count on your help to get there? < SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN TODAY < Friend, we MUST start this year strong, because the D.C. Democrats know that Tim Kaine is vulnerable and wildly out-of-touch with Virginians, so they will pour tens of millions of dollars into this race to prop him up and win majority control of the U.S. Senate. A shocking eight million illegal immigrants have come into our country during Joe Bidens watch. Thats nearly the population of the Commonwealth of Virginia! Its insanity! More than 100,000 overdose deaths occurred last year from fentanyl trafficked through Mexico. Thats roughly the population of Roanoke. Its an absolute tragedy! And a completely preventable one at that! While the streets are saturated with this opioid-poison, President Biden has seen fit to commute the sentences of convicted meth and crack cocaine dealers. Bidens soft-on-crime policies are wreaking havoc and ruining lives. Career politician Tim Kaine is along for the ride. Senator Tim Kaine votes the Biden way nearly every time. With Joe Biden in the White House, the world is on fire and the southern border is burning. Meanwhile Liberal Tim Kaine is offering his friend a match. Friend, we are losing our country. We cant let that happen. Thats why Im running for Senate . . . continuing my service after 25 years in the U.S. Navy . . . after deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia . . . after seeing what the Biden-Kaine Democrats are doing to this great country. Theyve turned our border into a war zone! We must build the wall. We must use advanced technology to repel the illegal alien invasion. We must reinstate Trumps Remain in Mexico policy for this reason: IT WORKS! Its time for new leadership in Washington, D.C. and its time for Biden and Kaine to go. < < < < < <m not done fighting for America. And I know you arent either! < SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN TODAY < I cant thank you enough for your generous support. Its inspiring. Its strengthening. Its already making a powerful difference because our campaign is making progress daily. But as I said, its time to up our game. Knowing that Washington, D.C.-financed Tim Kaine is going into full attack mode, our campaign must find a way to raise $30,000 in the next 8 days. Our campaign is aggressive because it must be. Were taking our anti-Biden message to all 95 counties and 39 independent cities. Were taking our anti-open border, anti-fentanyl message to all 8.7 million Virginians in 3.3 million households. With your ongoing support, well take Politician Tim Kaine to task for his nearly 100% pro-Biden voting record with Virginias seniors, veterans, farmers, small business owners, professionals, factory workers, and gun owners. Weve got a lot to do . . . and Election Day is less than 10 months away. Weve got a lot to raise . . . $30,000 and just 8 days to do it.

I dont publicize what I say there, but I can tell you that at the last six meetings Ive continually raised this topic, to an increasingly warm and interested response. The results are coming in. Justice Scalia had a trick where an intermediary would wangle a personal invitation for him to a hunting resort, and Scalia would pretend that made it personal hospitality that did not need to be disclosed, even if hed never met the resort owner. The Judicial Conference blew that trick to smithereens. The creepy billionaires instruct their chosen justices how to rule through amicus briefs, filed in little flotillas by groups who dont disclose their common donors. Think of amicus briefs as judicial lobbying. In one case, an entity filed a brief under a fictitious name; in another, a 501c3 nonprofit entity was the petitioner, and the amicus flotilla failed to disclose funding from the 501c3s own 501c4 counterpart organization. The Judicial Conference has announced its working to clean that scheme up. In the Scalia trick matter, Justice Thomas instantly claimed it was a new rule, though the Conference had called it a clarification. Its a big difference: if it was a clarification, Thomas (and Alito) would have to go back and clean up years of false filings. The Conference is looking into that, too, and it could be a big deal if justices have to reveal past gifts. This is just to let you know that in addition to my legislative and investigative work on clean-up at the Supreme Court, Im making progress in this unexpected forum. Separately, I had a red state federal Circuit Court of Appeals judge grasp my arm at an event and tell me how important this all was dont let up was his message. I wont.

It wasnt long until the courts in Alabama, which have also been influenced by creepy billionaires, imperiled the dreams of couples who are trying to have a child through IVF. A Senate-controlled GOP would be empowered to impose a national abortion ban and put more restrictions on access to IVF and family planning.

We heard a forceful, hopeful case for progress from President Biden in his State of the Union. The President commanded the room and Republicans left the House Chamber looking defeated. President Biden made it abundantly clear that he is energetically fighting for the middle class. Hes putting a real check on corporate power and the crooked fossil fuel industry. Big special interests arent able to run the show anymore like they did under Trump. The President also strongly addressed the climate crisis and pledged to rid our political system of poisonous dark money. He didnt stop there. I couldnt have been happier to hear him call for safeguarding Social Security and Medicare by making the wealthiest Americans finally start paying their fair share. I have a bill to do just that. We all know that under a Republican-run government, those bedrock middle-class programs would be under attack. The President renewed his call to level the playing field so teachers and firefighters dont pay a larger share of their income taxes than billionaires. I have a bill for that too. Were growing the middle class. There are big challenges ahead. We have to tackle climate change before its too late. We must defend democracy and freedom here at home and abroad. These battles will not be won overnight, but we can win them if we expand Democratic leadership in Washington. Democrats time and time again have shown our party is the only one that is willing and able to tackle these challenges. So Im personally asking: Will you donate what you can today to my re-election campaign so my fellow Democrats and I can continue to fight for a better future for every single American?

Before I do, will you consider chipping in to my re-election campaign so I can continue my work to clean up the mess at SCOTUS? I recently published a law review article highlighting how this captured Supreme Court often simply makes up false facts to arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit partisan Republican special interests. Take Citizens United v. FEC as an example. Remember when the Federalist Society justices said that all the unlimited political spending they were unleashing would be transparent? Well, weve seen dark money in politics prove them wrong several billion times over. The Roberts Court ignored factual records that Congress and the lower courts compiled, and it refused to go back and correct its own error. The error is the law of the land. Our system is designed to leave fact-finding to the lower courts that hear testimony, make credibility determinations, and review evidence. The Supreme Court is then supposed to defer to and not alter factual records in its decisions. Think about it: if the Highest Court in the Land makes up phony facts, there is nowhere else the parties can appeal to. The captured Roberts Court has done a lot of this phony fact-finding in big decisions that have fundamentally changed life in America. The Dobbs decision that ended a fundamental freedom for women is another one that was built on made-up history. How are the American people supposed to trust a Court that makes up its own rules to concoct decisions that suit right-wing special interests? I wont give up my fight to improve transparency and accountability at the Supreme Court, but I need your help.

The decision crushed the hopes of countless Alabama couples who are trying to have a child through IVF. And it was a serious warning sign of how extreme the MAGA GOP has become. Then, this story dropped last week: Group tied to anti-abortion Trump mega-donors pours money into Alabama supreme court race - The Guardian, 2/29/24 The article details how a group connected to anti-choice billionaire Trump donors channeled more than half a million dollars to support the election of a current Alabama Supreme Court candidate who believes embryos were human beings whose lives begin at fertilization. Once again, we witness billionaires secret influence in the courts. The sordid scheme to capture and control our judiciary for the billionaire class isnt just happening in Washington.

Thats the date The Supreme Court has set to hear oral arguments on how Americans can access mifepristone, the commonly used abortion pill that has been safely prescribed for decades. This is the first major reproductive health care case SCOTUS will hear since it overturned Roe v. Wade. It could affect access to care for millions like for women in Alabama, where the Supreme Court just ruled that frozen embryos created during fertility treatments can be considered children. It could even limit the freedom of women in states that have voted to protect abortion rights. This case isnt coming before a Supreme Court that calls balls and strikes. This Court was captured through a decades-long campaign by far-right billionaires. The right-wing majority is not looking out for women theyre looking out for the dark money donors who got them on the Court. We need a Supreme Court that will give Americans a fair, honest hearing based on facts and precedent. Democrats are fighting for womens reproductive freedoms, but its going to take an expansion of our Senate majority to codify Roe into law and stop the far-right forces on the Court from imposing their extreme, anti-choice agenda on the American people.

Regular people making political contributions to candidates they admire use money on which they paid taxes. Not right-wing billionaires. Right-wing billionaires funnel dark money into the American political system tax-free. One of the worst abuses of this loophole was when far-right donor Barre Seid donated 100% of his ownership stake in a computer hardware company to a nonprofit run by none other than Supreme Court fixer Leonard Leo. That stake was worth $1.6 billion. The loophole in the tax code let Seid avoid up to $400 million in taxes boosting the money Leo could use to warp our politics and push more far-right judges and justices on the bench. Its not good for democracy when a single donor can transfer assets worth $1.6 billion to a dark money political group, and its even worse when its a multi-hundred million dollar tax dodge. If you agree that billionaires attempting to influence politics from the shadows should not be rewarded with taxpayer subsidies, add your name to my petition now to support my new legislation > The End Tax Breaks for Dark Money Act would ensure the super-rich cannot avoid taxes while corrupting our political system. It makes donations of appreciated assets to nonprofit organizations subject to the same rules as gifts to PACs.

MARK YOUR CALENDARS and SET A REMINDER! August 20, 2024, a day when Wyoming\\'s voice roars throughout the nation. This past week, we clinched a significant victory at the Lincoln County Convention heads-up straw poll. We dominated with 66.9% of the vote, leaving John trailing at only 17.2%. It\\'s a victory for all 578,000 Wyomingites who refuse to be silenced. Together, we\\'re ensuring that come August 20, 2024, Wyoming\\'s voice will roar in every corner of the Capitol. This week will be in Teton County at their County Convention on Tuesday March 19, 2024! I look forward to seeing all of you there and hearing from each of you. Since last August, 2023, I\\'ve crisscrossed Wyoming, listening to your concerns firsthand. From border security to the economy and infrastructure, I\\'ve heard it all. Let\\'s be clear: it\\'s time for action, not more empty promises. 20 years of failed promises is enough! Border security is non-negotiable. I\\'m unapologetically committed to shutting down the border until we regain control. Our current Senator\\'s failed policies have left our borders porous and our communities vulnerable. It\\'s time to put an end to the political games and secure our sovereignty once and for all. NEVER FORGET that John voted AGAINST President Trumps Border wall in November 2019! Now, let\\'s talk about the economy. Accountability is sorely lacking in Washington. Our current Senator talks a big game about balanced budgets but fails to deliver. In fact, he has voted in favor of EVERY single massive Omnibus bill that has ever been presented! He has caused the inflation you are seeing today. On average Wyoming families spend $1200 per month more than they did just 4 years ago. He lied to You when he told you it was TRANSITORY. It\\'s time for real leadership, not empty rhetoric. Let\\'s elect representatives who put Wyoming families first, not their own political agendas or personal gains. And don\\'t get me started on infrastructure. Wyoming deserves better than crumbling roads and outdated utilities. It\\'s time for a bold vision that prioritizes rebuilding our infrastructure for the 21st century. Let\\'s invest in Wyoming\\'s future without breaking the bank or bowing to special interests. NO MORE GREEN NEW DEAL! Finally, remember this: \"As regulations grow, our freedoms die.\" It\\'s time to reclaim our freedoms and demand accountability from our elected officials.

I\\'m here to bring you up to speed on the whirlwind of events that unfolded, packed with meetings, conventions, and powerful discussions across our great state. Firstly, hats off to all the counties in Wyoming for their County Conventions! While the Teton County GOP Convention got snowed out and rescheduled for March 19th, I had the incredible opportunity to connect with many of you throughout the week. Each meeting, each handshake, and each conversation filled me with renewed energy and determination. Our journey began with a robust gathering in Sheridan, where I stood shoulder to shoulder with local leaders, supporters, and our esteemed Veterans from Sheridan County. Together, we delved into the pressing issues of police officer safety and training, confronting them head-on. Let me make one thing abundantly clear: reinstating law and order and ensuring public safety are paramount. I stand firmly with our courageous law enforcement officers, who have been unfairly targeted and undermined by the actions of Joe Biden and the radical left. Under their watch, our police forces have been defunded, demoralized, and dismantled, leading to a surge in crime and violence. It\\'s time to put an end to this madness. As your Senator, I pledge to prioritize record funding for police recruitment and training, bolster protections for law enforcement, and ensure swift justice for violent offenders. My stance on border security is unwaveringwe need to slam the brakes and shut it down until we regain control. Persisting with failed policies, like those championed by our current Senator for the past two decades, is nothing short of insanity. Midweek, I had the privilege of attending the Natrona County Convention, where what started as a Meet and Greet quickly evolved into a town hall meeting. It was inspiring to see such enthusiasm and engagement from everyone present. Remember, \"As regulations grow, our freedoms die.\" Then, it was off to Lincoln County for their convention in Afton, Wyoming. The turnout was incredible, and I had the opportunity to hear firsthand the concerns of delegates and supporters. We discussed the alarming implications of S.1348, a dangerous piece of legislation penned by my opponent, John Barrasso. This bill would empower D.C. bureaucrats at the Bureau of Land Management and expedite the Biden Administration\\'s plan to seize 30% of Wyoming\\'s public lands by 2030. It\\'s unacceptable, and it underscores where John\\'s loyalties truly lienot with the people of Wyoming. At the Lincoln County Convention, we conducted a Heads-Up Straw Poll: Rasner vs. Barrasso for United States Senate. The results were clear: Rasner garnered 68.9% of the vote, while Barrasso trailed with a mere 17.2%. This momentum is undeniable, and victory is within our grasp! Looking ahead, I\\'m eager to continue crisscrossing Wyoming, meeting each and every one of you, and understanding how best I can serve our state. This week promises to be just as busy, but I wouldn\\'t have it any other way. If you spot me out and about, don\\'t hesitate to stop and say helloI thrive on your questions and conversations. A heartfelt thank you for your steadfast support, prayers, and contributions. Together, we\\'re paving the way for a brighter future for Wyoming.

View this email in your browser ( Jenga, Let me bring you up to speed on the whirlwind that was this past week. It's been a rollercoaster of events, and I'm here to give you the rundown in my no-nonsense style. First off, I marked my 40th birthday with my family in a quiet and private celebration. But there's no rest for the determined, so the very next day, I was back on the campaign trail, crisscrossing Wyoming. We kicked off the week with a critical meeting in Fremont County, tackling head-on the alarming surge in crime statewide. It's a pressing issue, exacerbated by the chaos unfolding at our borders. It's utterly frustrating to recall that in 2019, John opposed funding for the border wall, turning a blind eye to our security needs. Now, we're grappling with the consequences of that shortsightedness, and it's high time for decisive action. I've been crystal clear about my stance: we need to slam the brakes on the border and SHUT IT DOWN until we get a handle on things. Continuing down the same path and expecting different results? That's pure folly and the definition of insanity. Later in the week, I had the privilege of attending the Niobrara County Convention, where the outpouring of support was truly humbling. Niobrara County holds a special place in my heart, with many dear friends and clients residing there. They understand, just as I do, that we need fearless leadership to push back against suffocating regulations and get our financial house in order. not a puppet to the deep state doing McConnell's bidding. Never forget, 'As Regulations Grow, Our Freedoms Die' Then, off we went to Teton County for the weekend. Despite getting snowed ina classic Wyoming surprisewe didn't miss a beat. Even had to lend a hand when we encountered a jack-knifed truck on the way to Jackson. But with grit and teamwork, we got things sorted and back on track. Although the county convention was postponed, I relished the chance to connect with voters over brunch and coffee. After all, a little snow never stopped Wyomingites from getting things done! Looking ahead, mark your calendars for Thursday, March 7th, at the Ramkota Hotel in Casper from 5-6pm. Due to overwhelming support, we've upgraded our venue to the 'Teton Room.' Swing by for some nachos and a chatit's bound to be lively! And let's not forget: I'll be making a return trip to North Lincoln County for their County Convention on Saturday. Can't wait to catch up with everyone there. A heartfelt thank you for your unwavering support, prayers, and contributions. Together, we're forging a path to a brighter future for Wyoming.

TELL KAINE, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Dear Jenga, Three decades of career politician Tim Kaine is enough.

It\\'s time for a better tomorrow! Eddie Garcia stands in clear contrast to the failed policies of the past. As the son of a ranch-hand from humble beginnings, with 22 years of military service, Eddie\\'s priorities are the forgotten men and women of Virginia. While Kaine hobnobs with the political elite in D.C., Eddie has been a constant presence among Virginia\\'s hard-working men and women. While Kaine rakes in millions from special interests and the billionaires\\' clubs, Eddie is relying on working people like you get his message to voters. In order to have a government that is for the people, we need a candidate who is funded by the people.

First, speaking with Virginia and national broadcasters at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) Conference at National Harbor in Maryland. Two of my favorite radio hosts, Joe Thomas of WCHV in Charlottesville and John \"Godzilla of Truth\" Fredericks of the John Fredericks Media Network covering all the Commonwealth were at CPAC. John was extremely kind. You can watch HERE when he complimented our campaign for the grassroots energy and his \"we need you in the Senate to shake things up\" comment. And then Wednesday of this week, it was a pleasure to speak with Larry O\\'Connor and Julie on WMAL, Washington\\'s top talk show. You can listen to the interview HERE about military readiness, veterans affairs, our campaign and my efforts to bring new voters into the Grand Opportunity Party. The numerous radio and podcasts interviews are allowing our message to reach tens of thousands of Virginians ready for change. As I stated to Larry, Tim Kaine represents Virginia of 1994, I represent Virginia of 2024 and we can build a government that works for all Americans. We are now entering the forum, debate and straw poll season of the campaign and I am pleased to relay we won the recent Spotsylvanai Candidate Forum Straw Poll. Building A Better Tomorrow is my forward looking plan to help ALL Americans. Not just the rich and well connected in Washington but every citizen. I spent 22 years protecting our country from outside threats and I am ready to serve again, fighting the \"insiders\", the lawyers and lobbyists, that dominate and cozy up with the career politicians like Tim Kaine. Join me HERE in my campaign to save America. God Bless, my best wishes to you and your family and I look forward to seeing you soon on the campaign trail! Eddie P.S.

It is time for a new generation of leadership for the Republican Party and one that is not beholden to the DC special interest groups and their money. It starts here in Virginia! Thank you to all the Garcia volunteers across the Commonwealth that have been collecting the thousands of signatures necessary to get on the ballot. As compared to other candidates that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring outside firms for paid signature collectors, our campaign decided to build our grassroots dedicated Virginia conservative network to do the job. This same grassroots network is now committed to working extra hard to see a major upset here in the Commonwealth while those paid signature collectors are out working in Michigan, Nevada or somewhere else. A direct quote from a paid signature collector when asked about the candidate she was working for,\"I don\\'t know anything about him, I\\'m just paid for the signatures\". If you are not willing to work for the Republican nomination and think you can buy it, Tim Kaine and the Democrats will out spend you and defeat you all day.

He has taken the time to both listen to the people and tell us who he is and what he stands for. He has my vote locked up! I can\\'t imagine any of the other candidates putting forth the effort in this area. I\\'ll listen to them if they come out of courtesy, but from what I\\'ve seen none of them are deserving of my vote.\" Just over a year ago I began my campaign, and like my 22 years in the US Army and 6 deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, my goal was and still is to outwork everyone else seeking to take on Tim Kaine. Then I will turn my full force to work harder, faster and better to defeat the Liberal Democrat this November. Tim Kaine, who has sat in public office for over 30 years and who has pushed legislation that is destroying our communities! I am a 24/7 candidate and have traveled thousands of miles to meet with fellow conservatives like you to clearly state where I stand on today\\'s important issues (which you can find here) and how we are going to form a coalition that will beat Tim Kaine. We will build on the strong foundation of Virginia Patriots across the Commonwealth and then bring in new voters, young voters, the Latino community and veterans. Remember, the British had more power and more money but what they didn\\'t have was that overwhelming desire for freedom and to win. The DC political class is already dismissing our grassroots 24/7 campaign because I haven\\'t raised \"stacks\" from the Washington lobbying crowd or their corporate elites. Our campaign has been funded by donations from patriots like you and I will not be owned by the swamp. Today, I am asking if you can make a grassroots donation of $15, $24 (our most popular donation), $50, $100 or more HERE to help expand our coalition and allow me to reach out to more voters across Virginia. Your contribution allows us to purchase the thousands of yard signs and the information material necessary to run a statewide coalition campaign. Your support allows me to continue our 24/7 approach to beating Tim Kaine and to prove to the DC crowd that a grassroots campaign can win in what they call a \"purple\" state. If you have previously sent our campaign a contribution. A heartfelt thank you and can I ask you to consider an additional donation to the campaign? Also, there is a box on the donation page HERE that provides for a monthly contribution which truly helps us with our planning and budgeting for the campaign. Your support is critical so please donate today! Thank you for your prayers and support to Veronica, the girls and me and for my campaign for a Better Tomorrow! We have, and will continue, to put all of our heart and soul into this effort. God Bless you and your family. With my best wishes Eddie P.S. You can find and sign up for all our coalitions plus volunteer here: and please follow me on the various social media platforms listed below. Thank you again for your support!

Kaine has been a career politician and in public office for over 30 years. Welcome to all our new readers of my newsletter and thank you to our long-time loyal friends that enjoy our bi-weekly report on our campaign. As I have mentioned often to many of you, one of my main efforts in defeating Tim Kaine is by reaching out and bringing in new voters to the Grand Opportunity Party! Building on our already outstanding grassroots base! For the past year I have been traveling the Commonwealth, not only meeting with Republican Committees, but also going into minority communities, churches and events to speak about their conservative values; how they align with the Republican Party and campaigning in those communities for our 2023 Republican candidates. This year, a record 36 million Hispanic voters are now eligible to vote in the 2024 U.S. elections and over 800,000 live right here in Virginia. BUT as the sub-headline above says, the once solid support to Democrats is dropping and do not identify with any party. We need to step up our efforts to bring them into the GOP, to connect with not only the Hispanic communities but also Asians, young voters, the working class and other non-traditional Republican groups.This is how I will beat Tim Kaine! Building A Better Tomorrow is my forward looking plan to help ALL Americans. Not just the rich and well connected in Washington but every citizen. I spent 22 years protecting our country from outside threats and I am ready to serve again, fighting the \"insiders\", the lawyers and lobbyists, that dominate and cozy up with the career politicians like Tim Kaine. Join me HERE in my campaign to save America. God Bless, my best wishes to you and your family and I look forward to seeing you soon on the campaign trail! Eddie P.S. It is time to stop the plan to put a casino in Northern Virginia! See my position on no federal support and how Richmond should stop this effort below. Thank you.

This is the #1 priority now for Team Garcia and our many coalitions, including Women United for Garcia. If you can help collect signatures at any upcoming events, please sign up to volunteer HERE and you will receive our weekly Volunteer Newsletter outlining locations where we need volunteers or you can just collect signatures in your neighborhood. We are preparing for the Virginia Pro-Life Day March next Wednesday, February 21st, in Richmond. If you can attend and volunteer, please let our petition manager, Britton Ross (brittonross9@gmail.com) know. We need as many volunteers there collecting signatures as possible.

I stand with Texas!\" - Eddie Garcia At the top of the newsletter, you will find a photo after my speech last week to the George Mason University College Republicans and above are photos from all the college campuses I have recently visited. I truly enjoy connecting with young conservatives to discuss the importance of personally standing strong and advocating for the protection of our Constitutional Rights. John Yep, CEO of Catholics for Catholics whom I recently met at President Trump\\'s Mar-A-Lago interviewed me last week about the border crisis, the war in the Middle East and how we find billions for foreign countries but not enough for our veterans and retirees depending on social security. We need to change Washington. Tim Kaine does not represent working Virginians. I contrast my beliefs in school choice, life and family values plus what is going on with Tim Kaine supporting the FBI\\'s targeting of Catholics. I thank Catholics for Catholics for the endorsement and the opportunity to share my Better Tomorrow agenda. Contact My Scheduler HERE to invite me to your next event or to interview When thousands of local residents protested, showed up at public meetings and signed petitions in Northern Virginia against putting casino gambling in the middle of their neighorhood, you would think the politicians would listen. They did not learn after Richmond residents defeated a casino twice. I am 100% against placing a casino in Fairfax County. It impacts families; increases crime and hurts those struggling with an addiction. No matter how much money (and it has been a lot) is \"donated\" to influence our state legislators. I promise I will do everything on the federal level to stop any effort. See my promise \"No Federal Money for Fairfax Casinos\" HERE. From one end of Virginia to the other, it was a busy couple of weeks out on the campaign trail. I was honored to read the Virginia Republican Creed at the Fairfax County GOP meeting and greet the couple of hundred attendees. Then lots of gun shows and meeting with Patriots in Salem, Dulles, Virginia Beach, Fredericksburg, Smith Mt. Lake and Chatham. I was especially thankful to City Chesapeake Vice Mayor John de Triquet and 3rd CD GOP State Central Committee Representative Carole de Triquet for their endorsement and holding a meet & greet at their home.

( Twenty three separate attacks on the 2nd Amendment and your Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Let that sink in for a minute. I dont know about you, but I know that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and especially Patrick Henry would be absolutely disgusted at what has become of their beloved Virginia. And it is time to change that. As I campaign in our great Commonwealth, I hear again and again people asking how this has happened. The answer is very simple- By not being personally engaged in the fight, the Left is winning. So now I am asking you, are your and your childrens freedom and the very fate of Virginia worth fighting for? If it is, I am asking for your help today. ( Virginia led the fight for Liberty. It was right here in Virginia that Patrick Henry uttered the famous words, give me liberty or give me death. It was right here that our Republic gained our independence from the British at Yorktown. And it is right here that we must make our stand. For far too long crazy Tim Kaine and his band of gun-grabbing socialists have held power over you, and it is time to end it. You can join me in that fight by simply clicking here to help our hard working volunteers fight and win to defeat Kaine this November. ( Sitting around waiting for something or someone else to act has brought us here. I am fighting hard, hour by hour, to defeat Crazy Kaine, but I need your help. Without his army George Washington would have never defeated the redcoats, and without you I will never defeat Tim Kaine. Can I count on your support? If so, it is vital that you click here to help me reach my fundraising goal of $50,000 so that we can send Crazy Kaine to the retirement home for bad politicians.

Yes, Donald Trump is a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe, a homophobe and a religious bigot. Yes, Donald Trump denied his election defeat, peddled conspiracy theories, and converted the Republican Party into a cult of the individual. Yes, Donald Trump has contempt for a free media and criticism. He has encouraged violence and the never-before-seen use of the military and federal agents against U.S. citizens. But if you believe Donald Trump\\'s first term was dangerous, I want you to think for a moment about what a second term would look like in terms of policy if a majority of Americans vote to support him and give him a mandate for another four years in the White House. If Donald Trump is elected this November, the fight against climate change is over. Period. Not only does Trump believe climate change is a \"hoax,\" but he has and will once again appoint agency leaders and judges who undermine our ability to move toward sustainable energy and protect the environment. If the U.S. retreats from the fight against climate change, countries like China, India and the rest of the world will follow. That would have irreversible implications for the future habitability of our planet for future generations. If Donald Trump is elected in November, the already obscene levels of income and wealth inequality in this country will only get worse. In his first administration, Trump signed tax cuts into law where 83 percent of the benefits went to the top 1% while raising taxes for middle class families. The cuts added almost $2 trillion to the deficit, yet Republicans wasted no time finding religion on the issue of the debt when it came to paid family leave, universal pre-K, expanded home care and more. During this current campaign, Trump has promised to extend those tax cuts for the rich and lower the corporate tax rate even further. We should believe him. If Donald Trump is elected again in November, we can expect him and the Republican Party to escalate the attacks on women\\'s reproductive health in this country. No, it was not enough for the Trump to brag about appointing justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in this country, he and other Republicans have backed a federal abortion ban if he is elected for another term. If Donald Trump is elected again, I happen to believe that the almost 250-year experiment of American democracy is all but over. It goes without saying that Trump tried to overturn the results of the last presidential election, but his attack on democracy goes far deeper than the violence of January 6, 2021. If Trump wins, you can expect more extreme gerrymandering, more election workers being harassed and threatened, and as a result of his policies and lies, more and more people increasingly believing democracy itself, and our government, does not work for them. It does not end there. If Donald Trump is elected, he will once again attempt to overturn the Affordable Care Act and throw millions of people off of their health care. If Trump is elected, we will take gigantic leaps backward on issues of education, gun control, criminal justice reform and immigration. And if Donald Trump is elected again, it would strengthen the hand of authoritarian leaders he openly respects and admires around the world like Orban in Hungary, Putin in Russia, Xi in China, and many other countries like Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and elsewhere. So those are the stakes. Now what do we do about it? Of course, it goes without saying that we must do everything we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden. No excuses! But let me also add that while President Biden and those of us who have worked with him have every right to be proud of what we have accomplished especially given the fact that the work was done in a very divided and contentious Congress -- I personally agree there are a number of areas where the administration\\'s response to issues has been inadequate or dead wrong. So while it is critically important we do everything we can to defeat Donald Trump, it is just as important we work to elect progressives this November and push President Biden to enact a progressive agenda in his second term. That is going to be a major focus for me throughout the rest of this year, and I can use your help in getting it done. If you can, please contribute $27 (or whatever you can afford) to support my work mobilizing progressives to defeat Donald Trump and to elect other progressive members of Congress this November. CONTRIBUTE NOW: Thank you for standing with me in this fight. In solidarity, Bernie Sanders CONTRIBUTE NOW: You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:',\n  \"[IMG] Friends - Last night, Donald Trump won the Iowa Caucus, putting the most dangerous president in American history one step closer to returning to the White House. Now, I don't have to tell you what this election is all about: it will determine whether our country continues as a democracy or whether we move aggressively down the path of authoritarianism and oligarchy. But what you may not know is that our political revolution has a very important role to play in determining the outcome. If you already know and understand we have important work ahead, I am asking you to make a contribution to help me get that done: Otherwise, let me explain a little more about the difficult and complicated political situation which we are confronting. We have all seen poll after poll showing Donald Trump has an excellent chance of being re-elected next November. But when you dig deeper into the numbers you see Joe Biden struggling with groups that we have historically done very well with and who have been part of our coalition - young voters, working people, and people of color. Frankly, these voters are not happy with some of what the president and his administration have done - or has not done. I get that. And I, personally, dont disagree. There are a number of ares where the Administrations response has been inadequate or dead wrong. But, sitting out this election or even voting for Trump is definitely not the answer. That leads to catastrophe. So, what do we do? First, we make it very clear to the president and Democrats everywhere that if they want to win this election they must have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests and campaign on progressive principles. Millions of working families are hurting, and they must respond to that pain. Further, we expect Joe Biden's second term to be far more progressive than his first. During the campaign our job will be to aggressively educate and organize at the grassroots level around our progressive agenda. The American people are deeply unhappy with the economic and political status quo. They want change, real change. That means we must roll up our sleeves and do the hard work of reaching new people. But our work must not stop with the presidential race. As we speak, parts of the Democratic Corporate Establishment are spending a huge amount of money trying to defeat strong, progressive members of Congress, including a number of women of color. One group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has pledged to spend $100 million to defeat progressives members of Congress like Ilan Omar, Cori Bush, Rashida Tlaib, and other allies of ours in Congress. What this super PAC is doing is outrageous and speaks to the corruption of our political system. When we talk about billionaires and big money buying elections, this is exactly what we are talking about. This is the Oligarchy at work. These big money interests will do and spend whatever it takes to try to stop our progressive movement and maintain the inequalities and injustices that exist. We must fight back, and with your help we will. So there it is. A lot of important work ahead of us. And not to scare you, but nothing less than the very future of our country and our democracy is on the line. Now, you know that since our presidential campaign I have rarely asked directly for contributions, but today I am once again asking for your financial support: Can I count on you to make a contribution of $27, or whatever you can afford today, to help fund our work to defeat Donald Trump and elect progressive members of Congress? Can I count on you to help us make Joe Biden's second term more progressive than his first. CONTRIBUTE: There is an enormous amount of important work to be done. Lets go forward together and do it. Thank you for all you've done and will do to fight for a government that works for all of our people, not just the 1%.

And we can start by acknowledging that young people in America in particular have been through a lot, and that their confidence in politics, democracy and government has been shaken. The COVID pandemic, the worst public health crisis in 100 years, disrupted the education of our young people, increased isolation, anxiety and mental illness. We have extreme weather and climate change that, if we dont act boldly, will only become worse significantly impacting the future of young people in their lifetimes. In 2008, greed and recklessness on Wall Street plunged the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. As children they watched American households lose over $13 trillion in savings, wiping out the life savings of their parents and their retirement dreams. And now, while the richest people in America become much richer, the younger generation faces the reality that they may well have a standard of living lower than their parents. If this country is going to survive, if democracy is going to prevail, step by step the Democratic Party must regain the trust of young people in this country. That is not just the right thing to do. It is good politics. One place that the President and Democrats can begin that is by laying out an agenda that makes it clear they will address another unfortunate reality confronting young people in America: That reality is that when young people leave college we are saddling them with decades of debt just for doing what we tell them they need to do in order to be successful: get a college education. That reality is that there are many hundreds of thousands of young people who are graduating college with $50,000, $100,000, or more in debt and some of them, for financial reasons, aren't even able to finish their degree. The tragic reality is that in the richest country in the history of the world, too many of our young people are giving up their dreams of a higher education because they fear the enormous amount of debt they will face when they leave school. And the absurdity is that this is a moment when we desperately need a skilled workforce! At a time of major labor shortages, how many great doctors, nurses, scientists and teachers are we losing because our children cannot graduate college without mountains of debt? At a time when we are trying to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and transform our energy systems away from fossil fuel, how many young people who need training in order to become skilled mechanics, carpenters, welders, and electricians will not get the post-high school training they need? How many great businesses will never be started? In the richest country in the history of the world, it is a national disgrace that we lead the world in the amount of student debt owed by our people and, at the same time, are falling behind many other countries in the percentage of our people who pursue higher education. In the richest country in the history of the world, hundreds of thousands of young people should not be giving up their dreams because paying off their student loans is too expensive. No, that is not what America is supposed to be about. It's time to hit the reset button. Our mission must be to give hope to young people. If every parent in this country, every teacher in this country, and every student in this country understands that if kids study hard and do well in school they will be able to receive a higher education, regardless of the income of their family, that will have a radical impact on primary and secondary education in the United Statesand on the lives of millions of families. Thats what we can accomplish by making public colleges and universities tuition-free and making certain that every American, no matter his or her economic status, has the opportunity for a higher education. Never let anyone tell you this is a radical idea. Tuition-free college is the norm in other modern nations, and its time for us to join them. This is not just good politics, it's good policy. That's not just good for the individual student, but it's good for our entire economy. In the 21st century, a public education system that goes from kindergarten through high school is no longer good enough. The world is changing, technology is changing, our economy is changing. If we are to succeed in the highly competitive global economy and have the best-educated workforce in the world, public colleges and universities must become tuition-free. If our country can provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent and profitable corporations, if we can cancel hundreds of billions in loans for wealthy business owners during the pandemic when Trump was President and if we can spend trillions of dollars on war and weapons, please dont tell me that we cannot afford to make college free in this country. Thank you for joining me in that fight. In solidarity, Bernie Sanders - Before you go. I think we all understand that if Republicans have control of the White House, the House or the Senate after this election, the chances of accomplishing anything significant becomes virtually non-existent. Our work rallying and organizing progressives across the country takes resources, but it is important work that must be done. So please: Can you please make a contribution of $27 or whatever you can afford to help our movement elect progressives all across this country who are prepared to address the long-neglected crises facing the working people of this country? You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:\",\n  \"[IMG] I understand that there is a lot that is going on in this world today. The situation in Israel and Gaza is horrific and brutal. Russia's outrageous invasion of Ukraine continues. Here at home we are looking at the very real possibility that Donald Trump the worst president in American history could become President of the United States once again. At the same time, we're trying to protect a woman's right to control her own body, the horror of increased gun violence is around us every day, and there is the not-so-small matter of a climate emergency that threatens the very habitability of our planet for future generations. But, despite all of that, there is an issue that is always on peoples minds because, by definition, it touches every single one of us. And that is health care, and the reality that today we have a dysfunctional and collapsing health care system. While it is not discussed much in the corporate media or in the halls of Congress, we have the most inefficient, bureaucratic and expensive health care system in the world. Thats not just what I believe. That is not just Bernie Sanders talking. Thats what the American people know to be true because of their lived experience with that system. And what is that system? In this country, like any other, people get sick. They go to the doctor. They get diagnosed and medicine is prescribed. But, in America, unlike other countries, they cant afford to buy the medicine their doctors prescribe. So, as their health deteriorates, they end up in an emergency room or a hospital at great expense to the system, not to mention personal suffering. Sometimes they die. Think about it: Every year in this country, tens of thousands of Americans die because they are uninsured or under-insured. Every year in this country, hundreds of thousands of Americans declare bankruptcy because of medical-related expenses. Does that make sense to anyone? And it doesn't stop there. Despite spending far more per capita on health care than any other nation, we dont have enough doctors. We dont have enough nurses. We dont have enough dentists. We dont have enough medical providers in general. We have more than enough people who bill us, and more than enough debt collectors who hound us to pay for a bill we cannot afford. But we just dont have enough people to provide the health care that we desperately need. And what's the result? The result is that our health care, our life expectancy, and other health care outcomes lag behind most other countries in the developed world. Unless you are wealthy. Then it's a different story. Today, the top one percent of Americans live 15 years longer than the poorest people in our society and study after study has shown that working class people live shorter lives than the wealthy. That doesn't seem right. So what is to be done? How does it happen that we spend so much money for health care, but get so little in return and what can we do about it? First of all, we must acknowledge the fact that it is abundantly clear that the current system is failing the American people and the American people want change -- real change. That is why I have introduced Medicare for All legislation repeatedly as a member of the House and the Senate. So what would Medicare for All do, and what are the costs? Quite simply, Medicare for All would improve and expand Medicare to cover health care for every man, woman and child in this country. That comprehensive health care coverage would end out-of-pocket expenses and, unlike the current system, it would provide full freedom of choice regarding health care providers. No more insurance premiums, deductibles or co-payments. No more networks which deny you your choice of doctors. And when I talk about Medicare for All being comprehensive, it would cover dental care, vision, hearing aids, prescription drugs and home and community-based care. In other words, it would do precisely what the American people want us to do. Would a Medicare-for-all health care system be expensive? Yes. But, while providing comprehensive health care for all, it would be significantly LESS expensive than our current dysfunctional system because it would eliminate an enormous amount of the bureaucracy, profiteering, administrative costs and misplaced priorities inherent in our current for-profit system. Remember: We currently pay twice as much for health care as do the people of virtually any other country all of which provide universal health care. So, yes, we can provide quality of care for all at a much lower cost per person. Under Medicare for All, there would no longer be armies of people billing us, telling us what is covered and what is not covered and hounding us to pay our hospital bills. This not only saves substantial sums of money but will make life a lot easier for the American people who would never again have to fight their way through the nightmare of insurance company bureaucracy. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare for All would save Americans almost $700 billion a year. Now, trust me. I know the 30-second ads from the insurance and drug companies have told us that if Medicare for All becomes law, your taxes will go up. But what they wont tell you is that under Medicare for All, you will no longer be paying premiums, deductibles and co-payments to private health insurance companies and there will be no more out of pocket costs. And what they certainly wont tell you is that Medicare for All will save the average family thousands of dollars a year. The struggle for Medicare for All will not be easy. Were taking on the greed and power of the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry who make tens of billions a year profiting from this broken system. Were taking on the massive amount of campaign contributions that go to politicians who defend their interests, as well as thousands of well-paid lobbyists who flood congressional offices. Guaranteeing healthcare to all Americans as a human right would be a transformative moment for our country. It would not only keep people healthier, happier and increase life expectancy, it would be a major step forward in creating a more vibrant democracy. Lets continue the struggle. Lets make this happen. In solidarity, Bernie Sanders - Before you go. I think we all understand that if Republicans have control of the White House, the House or the Senate after this election, the chances of accomplishing anything significant becomes virtually non-existent.

Please read my latest op-ed in on the issue below: - Big Pharma will have to answer to the American people One of my top priorities is to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America By Sen. Bernie Sanders It is no great secret that millions of Americans feel that Congress is more interested in protecting large corporations than looking out for ordinary people. That is never clearer than when we talk about our broken health care system, and the outrageous price of prescription drugs in this country. The truth is, if you ask most Americans Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, conservatives they will agree: we are getting ripped off, big time, by the pharmaceutical industry. As a nation, we spend almost twice as much per capita as any other country on health care over $13,000 for every man, woman and child. Even for those with insurance, costs are so high that medical bills are often the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States. And one of the major reasons for the high cost of health care in America is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. You tell me: why does Merck charge diabetes patients in the United States $6,900 for Januvia when the exact same product can be purchased in Canada for $900 and just $200 in France? Why does Johnson & Johnson charge Americans with arthritis $79,000 for Stelara when it can be purchased for just $16,000 in the United Kingdom? And why does Bristol Myers Squibb charge patients in our country $7,100 for Eliquis when the same product can be purchased for just $900 in Canada and just $650 in France? On and on it goes. Almost every prescription drug costs far more in the United States than it does in other countries. The good news is that we are beginning to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare, for the first time ever, is negotiating the price of some drugs, including Januvia, Stelara and Eliquis. The bad news is that the pharmaceutical industry is doing everything it can to stop these negotiations, and prevent Congress from making prescription drugs affordable for all Americans not just those on Medicare. The giant pharmaceutical and health insurance lobbies have spent huge amounts of money over the past decades to ensure that their profits come before the health of the American people. Over the past 25 years, the drug companies have spent $8.5 billion on lobbying. Today, they have some 1,800 well-paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C. including former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties. Unbelievably, that is more than three lobbyists for every member of Congress. During that same period, they have provided over $700 million in campaign contributions. And they are equal opportunity contributors. They contribute heavily to both Republican and Democratic candidates. The result of congressional inaction is that these large corporations have driven up the prices of prescription drugs to the point that one out of four Americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe. Meanwhile, while millions of Americans suffer and some die because they cant afford the prescription drugs they need, 10 of the top pharmaceutical companies in the country made over $110 billion in profits in 2022 and paid their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages. As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), one of my top priorities is to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America. One of the ways to do that is to hold the chief executives of some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in our country accountable for their actions. That is why I have invited Robert Davis, the CEO of Merck; Joaquin Duato, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson; and Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb, to a hearing to discuss what they are doing to lower drug prices in America. Why did we ask these CEOs to come before us? Because the American people deserve answers to some pretty simple questions. For example: Why is it that the median price of new prescription drugs in America is now over $220,000 including many new cancer drugs? How does it happen that while millions of Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, when major drug companies in America spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than they do on research and development? Why is there an enormous lack of transparency in how your companies set drug prices? These very straightforward questions are on the minds of millions of Americans. These are questions that the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to answer. And lets be clear: these are not struggling companies forced to charge high prices to survive. Believe me, they are not going broke. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made nearly $18 billion in profits, paid its CEO over $27 million in compensation and spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and dividends. That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit, handed out over $7 billion in dividends to their wealthy stockholders and paid its CEO over $52 million in compensation. And Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits last year, while recently spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and giving its CEO over $41 million in compensation. I am proud of what the committee has already accomplished. Last year, the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP Committee hearing that his company would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out of pocket. In a separate HELP Committee hearing last May, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products. The committees efforts are paying off, but much more needs to be done. I look forward to the hearing on Feb. 8, with the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers Squibb, to discuss how they will substantially lower the price of prescription drugs in America. - Before you go.

All volunteers statewide are now obtaining signatures to provide us a safe margin atop all minimums for the eleven congressional districts and statewide. Go Team Emord! Team Emord members obtained over 2,000 signatures at the TRUMP RALLY in Richmond alone! Thirty of our volunteers assembled there and gathered signatures throughout the day. In recent weeks, Jonathan appeared on national radio and television as well as at venues across the state, providing specific legislative solutions to the BORDER crisis; the DEBT crisis; the WOKE agendas in the schools and military; the climate change trojan horse for SOCIALISM; and the INFLATIONARY grocery and food prices that are depleting the income and savings of Virginians and Americans. Jonathan won a poll conducted of U.S. Senate candidates by the Fifth Congressional District by a wide margin. Tell the truth, please. Some competing candidates for U.S. Senate have intimated that President Trump has endorsed their candidacies. The truth is that he has not yet made an endorsement in the U.S. Senate race. Suggestions to the contrary are false. First Thing, First: We Need Your Help! HELP JONATHAN GET ON THE BALLOT You can help enormously with the completion of just 2 documents! For those who reside in Virginia and vote there, if you return a notarized petition to us (postmarked by March 14), it will add to our total collection effort and build the margin we need to ensure Jonathans name appears on the ballot. Request a Petition Form THANK YOU! Heres what you do: Print two copies of the 2-sided ballot petition (both sides to each sheet) as attached in this email. Together with your spouse (or adult Virginia voter child or friend), you sign one and they sign one. On line #1 of one petition, print your name (e.g., John Doe), insert your signature, your residence address that appears on the voter rolls, and the date. Then, again in the presence of your spouse (or adult Virginia voter child or friend), have him/her do the same on the other petition copy. In this way, you are the circulator of the petition signed by your spouse (or adult child or friend), and he/she {e.g., Jane Doe} is the circulator of the petition you signed. Have both signed petitions notarized by an official notary public. Only sign or date the petition as the collector when you are in front of a notary or else they could be invalidated. Each circulator must appear with his/her signed petition for the notarization. A notary public can be found at almost every bank, government service center, or library (usually done for free). In front of the notary public each circulator will sign his/her respective collected petition. This is on the second page just above the notary certification. The notary will then execute the notarization. Please inform the notary that he/she needs to write in the name of the circulator again where indicated. He or she must not include the name of a witness rather than the circulator in that spot, as that will invalidate the notarization. Finally, send by first-class mail the notarized petition to Emord for Senate, 11808 Wolf Run Lane, Clifton, Virginia 20124. All notarized petitions must be postmarked by March 14. For example, Petition Signer: John Doe Circulator: Jane Doe Front side. Back side. On the Campaign Trail Feb 20 Interview with Mike Adams Health Ranger Show Jonathan joined Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, for a fascinating in-depth discussion of Biden Administration policy toward Israel and the Ukraine; Biden Administration complicity with WHO to deny physicians independent professional judgment in the care of patients; and Biden abandonment of border protection and of Americans who have lost lives, liberty and property due to the migrant invasion. Listen here Feb 21 On the campaign trail in Richmond & across Virginia Jonathan joined people of faith from across the Commonwealth and participated in the rally for life in Richmond. He explained to individual attendees that under Dobbs, and under the plain and intended meaning of the Constitution, there is no federal power to authorize abortion nationwide and there is no federal constitutional right to abortion. He explained that as Virginias next Senator he will oppose every bill in violation of those federal constitutional limits. He also explained that the Founding Fathers left the issue of abortion to the states, as Dobbs held. He urged state law makers to end the binary debate that presents a false dichotomy between abortion and child rearing, giving women no meaningful alternative. He called for removing all major barriers to ADOPTION in Virginia, allowing the over 110,000 childless couples anxious to have a baby to come to Virginia and adopt, making adoption here a fully meaningful and available alternative for every woman unwilling or unable to care for a baby. He also called for state law makers to improve maternity care for all women in Virginia so that they receive truthful information on the known PHYSICAL and PSYCHOLOGICAL risks of pregnancy termination. Feb 22 Robert Scott Bell Show Jonathan appeared on the Robert Scott Bell Show, as he does weekly. He discussed at length Tim Kaines betrayal of Virginia voters. He described Kaine as a CORRUPT CAREER POLITICIAN. He explained Kaines involvement in the Clinton-Kaine campaigns Trump-Russian collusion hoax, a diversion away from Hillary Clintons violations of the Espionage Act and predicated on a Clinton-Kaine paid for bogus Steele dossier. He also explained Kaines long-term and close relationship with the Soros family, George and Alex. He explained Kaines utter FAILURE to introduce any measure that would halt the invasion of ILLEGALS across the border; stem the flow of FENTANYL, killing 5 Virginians a day and 130,000 Americans annually nationwide; stop federal DEFICIT spending and arrest the $34 trillion national debt; or end the WOKE transitioning and gender politics now dominating public school education and military training. He also explained Kaines direct support for measures that are destroying the fossil fuel backbone of the American economy in favor of the whole Biden climate change agenda. Kaine, Emord explained, represents himself to be a moderate but votes 98% of the time in perfect alignment with socialist Bernie Sanders. He does not represent the interests of Virginia. He represents the interests of the RADICAL LEFT of his political party and the interests of George and Alex Soros. Listen here Feb 23 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Jonathan attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) where he was interviewed by media and met many supportive Virginia attendees. Jonathan was interviewed by Joe Thomas of WCHV, the Silk and Joe Show, and CPAC itself. Feb 24 Lunar New Year Festival in Fairfax Jonathan attended an Asian Festival at the Luther Jackson Middle School and discussed the plight of the Falun Gong and other religious minorities &dissidents being persecuted by order of Xi Jing Ping in Communist China. He listened to several accounts from direct victims of that persecution, including their arrests, enslavement, barbaric organ harvesting, and brutal labor internment camps operated across China by its brutal communist dictatorship. Jonathan explained his opposition to Communist China and his intention to support legislation to restore President Trumps tariffs, forbid Chinese communist ownership of U.S.-based lands, properties, and businesses, bolster defense of American infrastructure, expand cyber defenses, and identify and remove all Chinese agents and foreign nationals committing espionage of business and government in the U.S. Feb 25 Candidate Forum Jonathan participated in a candidate forum at the Crossroads Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Although the vast majority of the roughly twenty-five attendees were volunteers in support of a competing candidate, following the debate many expressed support for the Emord candidacy and pledged to vote for Jonathan in the upcoming elections. Feb 26 Redwave Jonathan addressed approximately 75 people at Marshall Patties Redwave event in Harrisonburg, Virginia. He provided specific legislative solutions to the border, woke education, climate change socialism, and inflation issues. He also answered several questions from audience participants and welcomed the overwhelming support from those in attendance. Feb 27 Interview with O\\'Connor & Company Show Jonathan was interviewed by Larry OConnor of OConnor & Company show on WMAL - 105.9FM. He discussed his candidacy and specifically addressed Kaines misrepresentation of himself to Virginians. Kaine falsely represents himself to be a moderate to Virginians. He votes a straight far left line, supporting the entire climate change agenda that is destroying Virginia jobs; the trillion plus spending bills that are destroying the economy with inflation; and the woke agenda for the schools, including the Department of Education proposals to require biological males who call themselves female to enter girls and womens sports, locker rooms, and bathrooms. Listen here Feb 27 Interview with John Reid (WRVA) Jonathan was also interviewed by John Reid (WRV) for Richmond\\'s Morning News. He and John discussed the status of the Emord campaign and its statewide movement to win the primary election and defeat Tim Kaine. Listen here March 1 Interview with Andrew Wilkow on \"Wilkow Majority\" Andrew Wilkow interviewed Jonathan on the Wilkow Majority show (SiriusXM radio). Jonathan explained the utter absence of any basis on which Colorado and other states could exercise jurisdiction under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to keep President Trump off the ballot. He predicted a 9-0 decision by the Supreme Court against Colorado (or, at worst, an 8-1 decision). As it turned out, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the states lacked power to enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, thus keeping President Trump on the ballot. March 2 Interview with James Gormley on \"Citizens for Health\" Jonathan was interviewed by veteran health reporter James Gormley on the Citizens for Health podcast. Jonathan addressed the threats posed by international organizations to health freedom in the United States as well as his successful First Amendment legal challenges to FDA censorship of health information and to FTC censorship of claims associated with biodegradable products. James explained that he strongly supported the Emord candidacy. March 1 Meeting with Harrisonburg First Friday Group Jonathan joined the Harrisonburg First Friday Group at the Wood Grill Buffet in Harrisonburg. The issues addressed included Jonathans plan to introduce legislation to provide amnesty and immediate release to all J-6ers who neither assaulted police nor destroyed government property. He also explained his plan to amend the asylum laws to ensure that illegal aliens are prohibited from entering the U.S. to seek asylum, requiring instead that they seek asylum at U.S. embassies, either in their countries of origin or in adjacent countries, and that all INS administrative law judges that prosecute asylum applicants be moved to the U.S. embassies. That will ensure all vetting is done outside of the U.S. rather than inside our country. March 2 Rally for Trump in Richmond, VA Jonathan joined thirty members of Team Emord in Richmond at the rally for President Donald J. Trump. President Trump delivered a rousing speech contrasting his many achievements (securing the borders, keeping inflation low, ensuring economic opportunity and prosperity for all, ensuring American military strength, and protecting the U.S. from terrorism and war) with the abysmal failures of the Biden Administration in each of these areas. President Trump pledged to end the Biden open border, international appeasement, inflationary spending, and climate change agendas destroying the fossil fuel backbone of the American economy. Both before and during the rally, Team Emord members obtained over 2,000 ballot petition signatures. Many Team Emord members attended the rally, as did Jonathan as a special guest of President Trump. The first candidate for U.S. Senate to formally endorse President Trump in December of last year, Jonathan was himself endorsed by the Drain the Swamp PAC last month. March 4 Meeting with Newport News GOP Jonathan joined members of the Newport News GOP at their meeting in Newport News. He explained there the threats posed by Biden and Kaine to the survival and success of liberty in America, to the Constitution, and to the safety and security of every American. He explained his agenda to ensure that constitutional limits on government power are reinstated and to protect individual rights against government assumptions of power, like its mask and vaxxing mandates. Jonathan will introduce legislation to ban all masking and vaccination mandates from the federal government. March 5 John Fredericks Show at Gourmeltz Jonathan was interviewed on John Fredericks radio program. He explained that U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao had made false resume claims. Cao has repeatedly claimed that he balanced the Navys $140 billion budget, most notably right before Jonathans interview on the very same John Fredericks program. Cao, a Navy Captain at the time stationed at the Pentagon, could not have balanced the budget. That is a civilian function by law and is performed for the Secretary of the Navy by the Under Secretary of the Navy (Comptroller) not by active-duty military. Budget balancing is a civilian function (part of civilian control of the military) and is non-delegable to active-duty military. Listen here - Hung Cao: Fact vs. Fiction (Part 1) Jonathan also explained that Cao was not a Harvard or MIT Fellow, as Cao has claimed repeatedly. He explained that Cao misleads by claiming himself a fellow of Harvard and MIT based on his mere attendance at Executive Seminars through the Navy at those institutions for which no academic accreditation or fellow status is achieved. Listen here - Hung Cao: Fact vs. Fiction (Part 2) #IntegrityMatters March 5 Petition Collection on Election Day Jonathan joined Team Emords Ballot Petition Director Ann Parker and Team Emord volunteer Claude Harris at the Chimney Polling Precinct in Wirtz, Virginia. Parker, Harris, and Emord collected over 187 ballot petition signatures at the polls that day and interacted with voters urging their support for President Trump. March 6 Interview with Joe Thomas on WCHV Jonathan was interviewed on Joe Thomass morning program on WCHV in Charlottesville. Asked about Caos background claims, Jonathan pointed out that in fact Cao never lived under communism in Saigon as he intimated, but left the country with his parents before South Vietnam fell to the communists. He also explained that Caos many misrepresentations were disqualifying and that, in any event, would ensure his defeat to Tim Kaine were the party to make him its nominee. Listen here March 5 Meeting with Rocky Mount Patriot Network Jonathan addressed the Rocky Mount Patriot Network of Franklin County. He addressed every major issue facing Virginians and Americans, including the open border crisis; grocery and gas price inflation; WHO threats of centralized government control over the practice of medicine and patient care; the two-tiered system of justice and the unjust prosecutions of President Trump; the threat of a Central Digital Banking Currency to individual liberty; the woke agenda in the schools; the national debt; and the threat to the survival of constitutional government in America. In each instance, he presented specific legislative solutions. He received a very warm welcome with every member of the group pledging support for the Emord campaign. March 6 Interview with George Landrith on \"Frontiers of Freedom\" Jonathan was interviewed on the Frontiers of Freedom program by George Landrith. He explained why he, a constitutional lawyer with a long history of defeating the administrative state in federal court, is uniquely qualified to serve as Virginias next Senator at a time when the Constitution hangs by a thread in America. He explained in detail his legislative agenda to save Virginia and America. George Landrith, the host, expressed his strong support for the Emord candidacy.

Jonathan made campaign appearances and gave speeches across the state and was interviewed by major media. Team Emord collected over 1,500 signatures in a single week statewide, bringing our notarized total to over 6,500 in the week just past. Go Team Emord! Team Emord volunteers gathered over 500 signatures at the Virginia Beach SGK Gun Show on February 10 and 11. Traveling across the state, Larry and Cheri Fox obtained over 733 signatures themselves. Wow! Thank you, Larry and Cheri! Dozens of other Team Emord volunteers gathered signatures at various locations, including the Culpeper County Canvass in Culpeper, at breakfast clubs in several cities statewide, and at the Mason District Monthly Breakfast in Falls Church. On February 10 at the Charlottesville-Albemarle GOP in Charlottesville, Jonathan received praise for his precise legislative agenda to grant amnesty and release to J-6ers, end mask and vax mandates, secure the borders, eliminate inflationary government spending on climate change, cut taxes, cut regulation, end the woke agenda in the schools and military, and ensure restoration of constitutional limits on government power. On February 11, Jonathan was interviewed by WMAL host Dr. Thomas Roselle for a full hour. Roselle asked Jonathan probing questions concerning government efforts to restrict medical freedom and to coerce and cajole children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Jonathan explained that he will introduce legislation to ban government mask and vaccine mandates, including those affecting children and to restore a patient-centric system of medicine in America, one based on free market principles. Roselle expressed his strong support for the Emord candidacy. On February 13, at a Women for the American Constitution event in Charlottesville, Jonathan explained his legislative agenda and called on the audience to join the movement to Save America and Save Virginia by voting for the Emord candidacy. Jonathan explained that three quarters of all federal law is not the product of those we elect, but is the product of the unelected heads of over 250 federal agencies, departments and bureaus. Jonathan called for arresting and reversing the movement to transform the United States into a communist country. He called for restoration of constitutional government. In particular, he demanded that Congress make all laws, as required by Article I, Section 1, the Vesting Clause of the Constitution. Jonathan explained how a bill he wrote for and was introduced by Ron Paul achieves that end. That bill Jonathan will re-introduce. It prevents proposed regulations from having any legal force or effect unless passed into law by Congress. It also sunsets (eliminates) all existing federal regulation unless passed into law by Congress within three years of the bills enactment. On February 13, at the Mecklenburg GOP meeting, Jonathan explained the consequences of another Biden Administration, documenting the extent of economic, national security, and individual security harm caused by Bidens open border and climate change policies. Members expressed strong support for Jonathans agenda to reverse those policies and restore American greatness. On February 14, at the Virginia Beach Republican Womens Club, Jonathan addressed the group concerning the injury to life, liberty, and property posed by the federal Administrative State. He gave specific examples from his career in successfully attacking agency abuses. Not only has Jonathan defeated the FDA eight times on constitutional grounds, a record. He has also championed the causes of the unborn and of children victimized by federal agency abuses of power. The case of Zachary McConnell is one Jonathan discussed at length. Jonathans client Zachary McConnell was an 8 year old boy who suffered from an aggressive glioblastoma multiform (brain tumor). The FDA denied Zachary access to an experimental drug because he did not satisfy the FDA-approved protocol requirements. For a time, McConnell received the drug in the clinical trial and his tumor shrank by a third. FDA nevertheless ordered him off the drug, and Jonathan waged a battle against FDA to get Zachary back on the drug. Jonathan worked with Congressman Dan Burton, then Chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. Together they prevailed upon the FDA Commissioner to reverse FDAs decision. Thirty days lapsed between the time the FDA denied Zachary treatment and the time Jonathan and Dan succeeded in getting FDA to reverse its decision and allow Zachary back on the drug. Although restored to treatment, the thirty days allowed the aggressive tumor to grow substantially in Zacharys brain. The young boy died as a consequence. The FDA bears responsibility for his death. On the heals of that horror, Jonathan wrote a bill for Congressman Ron Paul designed to prevent any other terminally ill American citizen from ever having to face a bureaucratic barrier to receipt of an experimental drug. The bill Jonathan wrote, the Access to Medical Treatment Act, was blocked by the drug industry and FDA for years until Rand Paul introduced it as the Right to Try Act and Donald Trump championed it in his State of the Union Address and ultimately signed it into law. Now terminally ill patients have a legal right to access experimental drugs without FDA interference. On February 15, Jonathan spoke before the Republican Party of Norfolk. The members warmly greeted Jonathan and discussed with him the extent to which his background in constitutional law and victories over the administrative state made him the ideal candidate to take on Kaine, whose entire career involves defense, promotion, and expansion of the administrative state, including administrative state officials. For example, Kaine has championed the cause of the impeached Alejandro Mayorkas, DHS Secretary. Kaine said Mayorkas is doing an outstanding job. Emord called for Mayorkass impeachment and removal from office and for a complete reversal of the globalist open borders agenda of Mayorkas, Biden, and Kaine. On February 17 and 18, Team Emord volunteers gathered over 1,000 signatures at the Chinese New Year Celebration in Falls Church; at the Harrisonburg Showmasters Shenandoah Valley Gun Show; and at the SGK Gun Show in Doswell, Virginia.

The petition drive to get Jonathan on the ballot continued apace as volunteers across the state collected hundreds of signatures. Our Team Emord volunteers are profoundly motivated, indispensable and deeply appreciated. Team Emord and Jonathan interacted with patriots from across the state supportive of the Emord campaign: at the Showmasters Gun Show in the Dulles Expo Center (Feb. 2-4); at the RCWC meeting in Spotsylvania (Feb. 5); at Moes Italian Restaurant in Kenbridge, Virginia (Feb. 6); at the Rocky Mount Patriot Network of Franklin County in Rocky Mount (Feb.6); at the Lynchburg Breakfast Club (Feb. 7); at the Bagel and I in Lynchburg (Feb. 7); at the Lynchburg Arms and Indoor Shooting Range (Feb. 7); at the Lynchburg Heritage Club (Feb. 7); at the Republican Party of Chesapeake (Feb. 8); at the Red, White, and Blue and Catholic event in McLean (Feb. 8); at the Chesapeake Tea Party event (Feb. 8); at the MAGA event at Gourmeltz (Feb. 9); at the Virginia Beach SGK Gun Show (Feb. 10-11); at the Fairfax Mason District Monthly breakfast in Falls Church (Feb. 10); and at the Charlottesville-Albemarle GOP meeting (Feb. 10) Jonathan addressed patriots supportive of the campaign at the RCWC meeting in Spotsylvania; the rocky Mount Patriot Network; the Lynchburg Breakfast Club; the Bagel and I event hosted for Jonathan; the Republican Party of Chesapeake meeting; the Chesapeake Tea Party, the MAGA event at Gourmeltz; and the Charlottesville-Albemarle GOP. Momentum continues to build for an Emord victory in the primaries and over Tim Kaine. Jonathan appeared for interviews on national and local programs, including on George Caylor/On the Right Side Podcast; on Joe Thomass Morning Joe on WCHV in Charlottesville; on the Robert Scott Bell Show (as he does every Thursday); on the Wilkow Majority on SiriusXM radio; and on WMAL radios Dr. Tom Roselle Show in Northern Virginia. Jonathan addressed the constitutional crisis caused by Bidens insistence that the borders remain wide open against Texass demand that the illegal invasion be stopped. He also addressed oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the Colorado case, explaining that Colorado lacks jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment to construe the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and exclude Donald Trump from the ballot. We welcome all patriots to join the ranks of our army of volunteers, collect petition signatures to make sure Jonathan is on the ballot, and spread the word of our campaign and Jonathans unique constitutional background as a litigator and victor over the bureaucracy and as a constitutional scholar and defender of our countrys founding principles.

Dear Jenga, This is Sheryl Emord, wife of U.S. Senate Candidate Jonathan Emord. I wanted you to know how very grateful we are at Team Emord for those of you who have donated tonight in support of the campaign! Thank you! You have risen to aid Emord for Senate when it needs your help most. I am amazed at your generosity. I am also amazed at how hard Jonathan works day in and day out to let every Virginian know of legislative solutions to restore constitutional limits on government power, secure the borders, end inflation, protect our individual rights, and revitalize the American economy. Because Jonathan has written bills for members of Congress in defense of the Constitution and our constitutional rights, including the precursor to the Right to Try Act signed into law by President Trump, Jonathan will hit the ground running as soon as he gets into Congress. He needs no on the job training. He will introduce legislation to save Virginia and America the moment he is sworn into office. Support Jonathan Jonathan is an amazing and tireless constitutional litigator and scholar. I wish you could see him argue in federal court, as I have. Its amazing! He is a great, very skilled debater. He outwits the best lawyers. He will run circles around Tim Kaine. In fact, in one case Jonathan left one of New Yorks best lawyers so overwhelmed he could not articulate a responsive argument. Jonathan is also a man of great integrity, faith, and commitment to America. He is like a daily history lesson for our family. He has such a rich understanding of the founding principles of our country and of constitutional law and history that the words of the founding fathers frequently flow from his lips to our ears as he recounts the teachings of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and other founders. That he remembers their words in perfect detail is a testament not only to his intellect but also to his patriotism. If you have heard Jonathan speak, you have seen this remarkable talent in action. Everyone who knows Jonathan well knows he loves his country far more than himself. He will save it from Tim Kaine and the communist agenda, but he cannot do it alone. He needs you. He needs us. Our family supports his cause. Every freedom loving American should too. Please go on record right now with your support for Jonathan by donating generously before the deadline of midnight tonight.

Dear Virginia Patriots, Ron Paul knows Jonathan well. He has endorsed him for the U.S. Senate. Jonathan wrote bills for Congressman Ron Paul, including the predecessor to the Right to Try Act signed into law by President Trump. That predecessor bill, the Access to Medical Treatment Act, was introduced again and again by Ron Paul and was blocked every session of Congress by the drug lobby. Then Rand Paul introduced an updated version of the bill Jonathan originally wrote, and this time, with the backing of President Trump, the bill became law. The Right to Try Act saved countless lives by removing FDA from blocking terminally ill patients from having access to experimental treatments. That is but one of Jonathans many accomplishments that have saved American lives and liberty. A renowned constitutional litigator and scholar, Jonathan holds the record or defeating FDA censorship in court, eight times, earning him the name FDA Dragon Slayer. He is one of the few attorneys in American history to defeat the federal bureaucracy repeatedly, gaining him great respect from his colleagues and an AV rating (highest in legal ability and ethics) from the Martindale Hubbell law rating organization. Jonathans victories have saved countless lives, including those of the unborn. Jonathan seems destined for his role to restore our republic and uphold the Constitution against those who would replace it with a communist dictatorship. With a boxing legend and career military father and an off-the-charts smart mother, Jonathan had wonderfully patriotic and intelligent role models early in life that inspired him to fight for liberty, against communism and tyranny, and in defense of the American republic his entire career. A masterful debater who has outperformed the best attorneys the Department of Justice has to offer, Jonathan will defeat Kaine. But even Jonathan can't win this fight alone.

Do we keep electing the same old members of the swamp and ridiculously keep expecting different results, or do we choose a proven conservative fighter who will put America first? Team Eubanks has been outspent 150 to 1 by the current special interest owned (and 30 year member of the swamp) Roger Wicker. He has the money, because he does the bidding of his special interest donors. Thats why he votes with the Democrats more than almost any other Senate Republican, and regularly puts America and American values last. I do not do the bidding of special interest or leadership, never have, never will. I have a track record of showing that my only loyalties are to We the people.

He votes with Pelosi, Schumer, and the Biden Administration more than almost any other Republican Senator in Washington D.C. .

Our mutual destruction is all but guaranteed by our current national leadership. We are daily seeing horrific glimpses of our economic and sovereign trajectory play out. When will we wake up as a nation and realize that electing the same old politicians over and over again and expecting different results, is the true definition of insanity. It is impossible to trust those who are bought and paid for by the special interest who run D.C.. One needs look no further than campaign donations to see just what extent a politician has been co-opted. Theres a reason politicians like Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker have been able to remain in power and a part of the D.C. swamp for going on 30 years now. When one does the bidding of special interest donors, those donors reward these individuals with more funds than any potential challenger could ever hope to raise. With money comes the power, the power to shape the narrative and offer a spin to any truth. Doesnt matter if you vote with the Democrats more than almost any other Senate Republican. Doesnt matter if you have one of the lowest collective conservative ratings from all conservative groups. Doesnt matter if you put America last and push hundreds of billions of American taxpayer dollars to fund foreign border wars around the world (while leaving your own border wide open). Doesnt matter that you actually fought President Trump on securing the border. What does matter is that you are one of the largest military industrial complexes recipients of special interest dollars. Youve now got the money now to tell the voters over and over again how altruistic, conservative, and tough on the border you are. Youve got the money to tell people its all about national security, as your donors continue to rake in billions of dollars in profits. You can drop $5 million dollars in a primary race in a small state like Mississippi, and think nothing of it. Tell them enough times, theyll all start to believe the spin. Hope is not lost though, but it will be if we dont collectively break away from the statis quo and stand up to this system. People are starting to wake up. Every Mississippian, and every American, has the power to send a message to the entire ruling class of political elites and tell them This has to stop! Your sphere of influence, and the spheres of those you influence, is how grassroots is born. I will never be owned by special interest. I am running this campaign on my own donations and those of my friends, family, and fellow patriots. I am the only verified proven conservative fighter in this race. Ive signed a Term Limits pledge. I havent sold Mississippi out in my last 8+ years of legislative service, and I wont sell you out when you send me to Washington D.C. to fight for you. Now I need you to help fight for me.

How? The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Under Secretary Mayorkas, has issued a bulletin outlining his intention to criminalize mal/mis & disinformation that is related to health/environmental/political or other forms of information they determine qualifies. They have even went as far as calling domestic mal/mis & disinformation TERRORISM. So, if you have a different opinion than Dr. Fauci on COVID or you have concerns with how green energy is manipulating the conversation about climate change - then you might be a domestic terrorist. This sets a concerning precedence. Who at DHS or other agencies will determine this - where is the due process required by the U.S. Constitution? Source: ( < ). The Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) we NEVER voted on is the effort from the Biden Administration and originally comes from the United Nations (U.N.). The U.N. calls this effort, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Source: ( < ). These measures likely came out in the G20 Summits and other elitists events hosted by the European Union. Source: ( < ). Make no mistake, these events and these efforts were an effort to sow Socialism across many democratic nation states. As we look at Ireland, Denmark, Switzerland, or California - so will Utah eventually be if we dont have a Senator willing to fight and expose this regime change push here in the United States. In the short span of 3 years, the Biden Administration has mandated ESG and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) measures on companies in the United States. The Biden Administration (in partnership with FDIC lending institutions) has tied consequences to those companies who does not implement ESG/DEI standards - if a company does not adopt DEI, their social score is reduced and the likelihood of obtaining a capital loan is reduced. Source: ( < ). This must stop. I will gladly expose and push to defund or dismantle any institution who thinks this is the way we do business in the United States. The Importance President Washington said, \"If men are to be precluded from offering their sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences that can invite the consideration of mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of speech may be taken away, and dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.\" When we lose our 1st Amendment Right to free speech, the ability for good ideas to percolate to the top will not happen. With criminal or monetary criminal consequences, people will not voice their opinion. What can be done? I have prioritized exposing and preventing the degradation of our 1st Amendment and will push to have these agencies defunded and dismantled if they continue to stripe us of our 1st Amendment Right to free speech. as one of many tenants of my campaign for U.S. Senate. If you have the time or means, I encourage you to volunteer and help my campaign spread the word of Bidens push to remove our Rights. I have learned and studied threats in the Department of Defense (DoD) for 15 years - let me defend Utah as your U.S. Senator. I learned in the military, serving your country often requires a degree of sacrifice. It is this characteristic that reminds people, who are in federal service, that they serve their constituents or their country. Many politicians go to Washington for themselves - they invest in the stock market when they have insider knowledge of our economy or military investments. In federal service, we sacrifice our time, energy, and self to better an idea or cause greater than our own. When I look at many of our politicians, they are often more worried about their next election, or what donors they can convince to contribute to their campaign. It is a systemic problem we need to fix. Volunteer, Donate, or Host an Event I do not have big donors like the rest of the Republican party. To this point, I am entirely self-funded. It is expensive to run adds on social media or rent a room at City Hall or at a university. In fact, it is approximately $200 to $800 to purchase a booth at a Convention or to rent a room at a University. Advertising is also expensive. If you would like to host an event at your home or other place, there is a good chance I can attend. We also need assistance in canvasing, putting a yard sign up in your yard, or if your willing to speak to your neighbors. This years election is the most important election in my lifetime - there is too much at stake! The real concern is the cancer that divides our two-Party system. We need a U.S. Senator who can build relationships of trust by finding common political ground.

Larry Hogan, the former two-term governor of Maryland, is running for the United States Senate. I was thrilled when I heard the news. Let me tell you why.

Larry Hogan is trying to break that cycle. So am I. And heres the thing: Its not as crazy as it sounds. Hogan was a very popular governor in Maryland for 8 years. You know what that tells me?

They want politicians who solve problems, work across the aisle to get things done, and who put people over politics. No more useless, partisan politics. Those days are over. So if Maryland can look past party lines and elect a Republican problem-solver, then so can Delaware. Thats how much faith I have in our state. Like Larry Hogan, I too, am fed up with Washington politicians who are more interested in arguing than getting anything done for the people. We CAN do better, but not if we keep sending the same kind of politician to Capitol Hill. And like Hogan, I believe we can: * Cut taxes * Get tough on crime * Create a government that works for the people So what do you say? Are you ready for a new Delaware? Lets do better, together.

It was a terrific conversation worth reading in full here, but if youre short on time, Ill take a moment to summarize the four priorities were fighting for in this race: 1. Abortion access and reproductive freedom. MAGA extremists are working to roll back basic freedoms weve known for generations making abortion illegal everywhere even in cases of incest and rape. As a woman, as the mother of a daughter, this is completely unacceptable, and Ill fight it with everything I have. 2. Infant and maternal health. The lack of affordability, especially within our health care system, is costing New Jerseyans their health and lives. From prescription drug prices, to insurance premiums, to the cost of essentials like diapers and formula, we need to bring costs down and fast. New Jersey sends far more money to Washington DC than we get back, and Ill work to fix that as soon as Im elected. 3. Climate change. I led the charge to make New Jersey the first state to teach climate change in all K-12 schools and prepare our kids for high-paying, green jobs of the future. But we cannot fix the climate on our own, so we need leaders who will make addressing climate change a national priority. The next generations are depending on us. 4. Gun safety. New Jersey has some of the strongest gun safety measures in the country, but theres little we can do to stop folks from loading up truckloads of weapons in other states for transport into ours. We need to change the shift about guns treating gun violence as a national health emergency and make sure common-sense reforms like New Jerseys are in place at the federal level. My priorities reflect those of the people Ive met all across New Jersey. Theyre common sense, achievable, and wildly popular, but the current dysfunction in Washington is allowing our priorities to be pushed to the wayside. That needs to stop, and this election is a chance to stop it. If you agree we need action on these four priorities reproductive freedom, health care, climate preparedness, and gun safety please add your name to personally endorse my campaign today. ADD YOUR NAME >> Together, well secure new leadership for New Jersey in Washington, and we will fight hard for the overdue change New Jerseyans need. Please add your name if youre with me.

But for far too long, Ive watched Kevin Cramer focus on far-right issues and serving his mega-donors instead of tackling the real issues affecting our country. And frankly, I cant watch anymore. I know we simply cant afford six more years of Kevin Cramer. We need a voice in Washington who will fight for the people whove been put down, forgotten, and ignored. As Senator, Ill fight for your family like it was my own. Ill always have your back. But right now, I need you to have mine. So Im humbly asking: Can I count on your $15 before midnight to fully fund my campaign, retire Kevin Cramer, and give my vision for our future the chance it deserves to succeed? >> [ Im running for every child and family Kevin Cramer has turned his back on. I never dreamed Id run for office. But the thing is, I got fed up watching my friends and neighbors struggle with issues I knew we could solve with the right leadership. I knew someone had to stand up for the kids who dont have enough food to eat, the families who cant afford to go to the doctor, and the seniors barely getting by on a fixed income. And I looked in the mirror one day and realized that someone had to be me. Thats why Im running for Senate to make a difference for families struggling to get by. Instead of working to protect hardworking families, Cramer has turned his back on us. He even voted to cut affordable health care and against lowering prescription drug prices for our seniors. I believe the people of North Dakota deserve a Senator who will make life easier for working families, not harder. I dont like asking for your hard-earned money. But to unseat Cramer and flip this seat blue, I need all the help I can get. Can I count on you to help me reach my goal of 807 more donations before midnight? >> [ And finally, Im running for hardworking people like you. I know a lot of folks out there are feeling pretty worried right now. Were worried about the direction our country is going, were worried about what kind of future our kids will have, and a lot of us are just worried about how well make it through the day. I hear your concerns. I get it. And Im ready to do something about it. If you want a Senator wholl look out for you, not corporate donors If you want to build a future our children and grandchildren can be proud of If you want a leader who will have your back every single day in office Then Im humbly asking you to lend me your hand and help me make it happen. Because I promise you that as your Senator, you and your family not wealthy donors or special interests are who Ill fight for. I refuse to accept a dime of Corporate PAC money but Im relying on grassroots supporters like you to help me win this competitive race. I know theres nothing we cant do if were in this together. But Cramer has endless big donors just waiting in the wings to destroy our chances of flipping this seat blue. Thats why Im relying on you.

Listen, friend, as a Black woman, I always knew that I wouldn't raise the same amount as my opponents. On average, Black women fundraise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But I don't need to raise the most money in this race, because I have a powerful platform that is converting voters. That's why I know we can still do this. My opponents may be flooding the airwaves with TV ads, but that's not the only way to get out the vote. Instead, my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. None of this is cheap. An average yard sign costs about $5. And with 1 in 6 likely voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. But of course, I can't do this alone. There are only 3 days until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $25,000 to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help. So I'm humbly asking, to give my bid for Senate the best possible chance: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? Now is the time to dig deep so we can show wealthy elites that we CAN build a strong campaign from a grassroots team. Thank you, Barbara Lee - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

Right now, we have a real chance of sending progressive champion Rep. Barbara Lee to the Senate where only three Black women have ever served. But with just days left before Election Day, we can only pull this off if we all drop what we're doing right now and pitch in. That's why I'm helping my colleagueand friend Barbara get through her last big push of the election. People are already voting, so please:Will you donate $5 or more now to help Barbara Lee build a progressive future for all? Here's why Barbara Lee has my support: For over 20 years, she has fought for progress, inch by inch. And believe me, the path to progress has been anything but simple. Over the course of our time in Congress, I have watched Barbara fight fearlessly for the things she knew were right even if it meant standing alone in a crowded room. I've always been impressed by her strength, resolve and boldness and I know that she'll bring all of that and then some to the Senate. Friend, we knew this race would be tight to the very end, but we can't throw in the towel now. Recent polls show that 1 in 6 likely California voters are still undecided on who they'll vote for in the primary. That's why Barbara Lee and her team are expanding their voter outreach efforts on the ground and we needto support this work. Every single dollar that Barbara Lee raises from this moment to the moment polls close has the power to change the outcome of this race.

It's Kal Penn, and I'm proud to support Congresswoman Barbara Lee's historic run for U.S. Senate. Rep. Leeis the most progressive choice for California's Senate seat by far. That's why, with only 7 days left until Election Day, I'm stepping up to help send her to the Senate and I would love if you could join me by pitching in now to support her campaign. Barbara Lee has spent a lifetime fighting to advance the issues that truly matter to working families and at a time when we've seen a shocking right-wing shift among supposed Democrats, we truly need Rep. Lee in the Senate. She is the only person in this race that I can trust unequivocally to fight for the interests of the people not the mega-rich. I invite you to look at Congresswoman Lee's record; you will find that she has never deviated from doing what she needed to do to push the needle for progress forward. She was the only person in Congress to vote against giving President Bush unlimited war powers following 9/11, and she has since been staunchly anti-war. Her opponents cannot say the same. Friend, there's a reason why we've seen an abundance of human rights icons endorsing Barbara Lee's Senate campaign. From Gloria Steinem to Dolores Huerta to Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly NARAL), these leaders have shown that they trust Barbara Lee and her judgment. And I feel confident that I can place my trust in Rep. Lee as well. That's why I know that Congresswoman Barbara Lee is who we need as California's next senator, but she needs our help. Her opponents are spending millions on TV ads to drown out the competition, and she urgently needs more resources to compete. So, as a fellow progressive who is hungry for change, I need to ask:Will you make a small donation to Barbara Lee's campaign for U.S. Senate now so she can advance to the general election?

That's why I'm investing heavily in my grassroots operation which means more people to knock on doors, more people to phone bank and more Californians reached with my progressive vision.

It may not sound like much but between long hours spent in Congress pushing progressive legislation through and long hours on the campaign trail,a gap in my schedule like this is rare. I've been sittingwith a cup of coffee, reflecting on this incredible campaign that we've built together and the things in my life that led to my decision to run for Senate. And if you have a moment, I'd like to share my story with you too. I was brought into this world via an emergency forceps delivery when my mother was nearly denied admission to the hospital for the color of her skin. Things did not get better from there.Because despite my father retiring as a lieutenantcolonel who had served in both WWII and the Korean War and my mother serving as the first Black clerical worker at Fort Bliss,we still faced discrimination every single day. But despite all the things that my parents could not control about how the world treated me, theycouldcontrol how I was taught to treat the world. They instilled in me a fierce understanding that, no matter what people said, I wasnotand never would be lesser than my peers and that I must work hard every day to prove that. And that's a lesson that I've carried throughout my entire life. At the age of 15, when I wanted to be a cheerleader, I worked with the NAACP to integrate my high school girls' cheerleading squad. When I was struggling to make ends meet after escaping an abusive marriage, I still enrolled in college and even took my boys with me to classes when money was spread too thin to get child care to give myself the chance to reach my dreams. When I decided that it was time to bring the voices of Black women like myself to Congress, I ran in a special election and made it happen. And here we are now just 8 days away from the primary election and on the brink of making history. Friend, I'm truly so touched by all that you have given me so far, but I need to ask for your support once again: People are already voting. Will you please donate $5 or more to my Senate campaign now to help power us across the finish line? I'm meeting voters where they are in these final days. Thank you for everything.

And, if it inspires you, I'd appreciate it if you would make a donation to my historic campaign for Senate. When I was 15, after making the move from the deeply segregated South to California, I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But unfortunately, I didn't look like the kind of person that the selection committee would choose for the cheerleading team. I could've just accepted my fate and given up there but that's not the kind of person my mother, who was one of just 12 students to integrate her college, raised me to be. So instead, I partnered with the NAACP and despite pushback from the school administration, we were able to convince them to change the system from a selection process to an election process that would allow the whole school to vote. After trying out in front of the entire student body, guess what? I won. I became the first Black girl cheerleader at my school. And even better, other girls of color took advantage of the new process and were able to become cheerleaders that year as well. Barbara Lee proudly posing in her cheerleader uniform after successfully organizing the integration of her high school cheerleading team with the help of the NAACP. You see, friend, I've been working to break down barriers and dismantle unfair systems since I was just 15 years old and I'm nowhere near done yet. That's why I'm running for Senate and I hope I can count on you to join me. On average, Black women fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do, so I truly need every dollar.

I'll tell you why: Historically, Black women running for office only raise one-third as much as white candidates. And already, I've seen that painful statistic come to life. My opponents are raking in huge piles of cash from establishment elites and out-of-state special interests but together we can fight back. Earlier this month, Californians began to cast their ballots for the primary election, and I'm investing heavily in meeting voters where they are so we can get out the vote.

I'm proud to say that I have consistently ranked among the most progressive lawmakers in Congress and I'm the most progressive candidate in this race by a long shot. I'm the only candidate in this race who has consistently voted for peace and championed progressive projects such as the Green New Deal, Environmental Justice for All Act, and Medicare for All. Friend, I've spent my entire career fighting for the things that actually matter to working families and that's exactly what I'll continue to do in the Senate. But, with my opponents sitting on millions, I can only get there with the help of this powerful grassroots team. I know $5 doesn't seem like much but if every person reading this pitches in $5, we can build a powerful grassroots movement that can go toe to toe with my opponents. With the California primary election just 13 days away, I have to ask: Please: Will you give $5 right now so I can hit my goal to reach the voters I need to pull ahead in this race?

The latest polls show that nearly 20% of California voters are still undecided, and we can't afford to slow down, not even for a second. This is a make-or-break moment for me, friend, that's why it's so important I hit my daily fundraising goal by midnight. Will you donate $5 or more now to help me get back on track, pull ahead in the polls and build a progressive future in the Senate? Now here's a sad truth: Black women candidates on average raise just one-third as much money as white women (and even less compared to white men) a metric that has become painfully clear in the fundraising deficit in this race. And, while Black women candidates put our campaign contributions to work as efficiently as possible, there are only so many miracles that we can pull off. Friend, there is only one reason why a Black woman with my progressive experience in politics would lose this primary: money. Because I have proven time and time again, in more ways than I can count, that I will never waver in my fight for progress. Even if it means standing alone as the sole dissenting vote against what I know is wrong, I will always use my voice to defend those who have been voiceless for far too long. But I'm not naive, friend. I know that if I don't have the money to compete in this race, I can't pull ahead and I know that as a Black woman, fundraising will always be harder for me. But that doesn't mean that we should give up. Because, as the most progressive and experienced candidate in this race, I know my voice is sorely needed in the Senate. But to get to the finish line in this race, it's absolutely critical that I reach my daily fundraising goal.

That's absurd. And while working people struggle just to keep a roof over their heads, those same rich elites get to treat our elections like playgrounds and block critical legislation to address issues such as rising and unaffordable health care costs, student loan forgiveness and climate justice. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Enough is enough.It's time for the 0.1% to pay their fair share and restore political power back to everyday people. And in the Senate, I'll make it my mission to bring on real economic justice. That's why I'm personally asking: Will you pitch in $5 right now to power my fight for the Senate, where I'll battle to take on the wealth gap and corporate greed and ensure that the rich pay their fair share? A democracy where the 400 richest people have 22,000 times the political power of the average citizen is not a democracy at all.That's why I fought alongside Bernie Sanders to pass the Tax on Wall Street Speculation Act, which would implement a much-needed tax on the wealthiest Americans' transactions. But friend, fundamentally reshaping our economy isn't going to happen overnight. It's going to take a huge movement of working people who are sick and tired of being taken advantage of to stand up and take action. In the Senate, I'll be a voice for that movement. I won't back down,no matter how much they spend against me. But I can't do this alone. Please, will you rush a $5 donation to help me win my historic run for the Senate, where I'll never stop fighting to hold the 0.1% accountable?

It may not sound like much but between long hours spent in Congress pushing progressive legislation through and long hours on the campaign trail,a gap in my schedule like this is rare. I've been sittingwith a cup of coffee, reflecting on this incredible campaign that we've built together and the things in my life that led to my decision to run for Senate. And if you have a moment, I'd like to share my story with you too. I was brought into this world via an emergency forceps delivery when my mother was nearly denied admission to the hospital for the color of her skin. Things did not get better from there.Because despite my father retiring as a lieutenantcolonel who had served in both WWII and the Korean War and my mother serving as the first Black clerical worker at Fort Bliss,we still faced discrimination every single day. But despite all the things that my parents could not control about how the world treated me, theycouldcontrol how I was taught to treat the world. They instilled in me a fierce understanding that, no matter what people said, I wasnotand never would be lesser than my peers and that I must work hard every day to prove that. And that's a lesson that I've carried throughout my entire life. At the age of 15, when I wanted to be a cheerleader, I worked with the NAACP to integrate my high school girls' cheerleading squad. When I was struggling to make ends meet after escaping an abusive marriage, I still enrolled in college and even took my boys with me to classes when money was spread too thin to get child care to give myself the chance to reach my dreams. When I decided that it was time to bring the voices of Black women like myself to Congress, I ran in a special election and made it happen. And here we are now just 15 days away from the primary election and on the brink of making history. Friend, I'm truly so touched by all that you have given me so far, but I need to ask for your support once again: People are already voting. Will you please donate $5 or more to my Senate campaign now to help power us across the finish line? I'm meeting voters where they are in these final days. Thank you for everything.

Experts are already saying it\\'s \"likely to be the most important state election for voters in 2024,\"and I wholeheartedly agree. But as this race continues to unfold, it\\'s crucial to recognize the differences between myself and my opponents and I want to start with three of them: 1) I am the most progressive choice in this race. I was the only member of Congress to vote against giving President Bush unlimited war powers and against the war in Iraq. And unlike one of my opponents, I support and have secured earmarks for the benefit of Californians. 2) I am the only Black woman in this race. And as a result, I\\'ve had to fight twice as hard to get to the same place as my white peers. I\\'m ready to take the experience, struggles and voices of Black women to the Senate, where only three Black women have served. 3) My opponents are sitting on top of millions raised from out-of-state donors and special interest lobbyists. I\\'m running a grassroots campaign which means that it\\'s powered by you, for you. I don\\'t need to raise the most money, but I need to raise enough to stay competitive and reach the right voters to pull ahead. My record in Congress speaks for itself: I am not afraid to fight tooth and nail to do the right thing and stand up for justice no matter what obstacles are put in our way. But I can\\'t do this alone, so I have to ask: Can I count on you to chip in $5 to power my historic race for the Senate? This is quickly shaping up to be one of the most competitive races in the country, and every dollar makes a massive difference.

I'll tell you why: Black women running for office only raise one-third as much as white women. With this race becoming one of the most expensive in the country, I have to fight for every single dollar to pull ahead in the polls. $5 doesn't seem like much. But if every person reading this pitches in $5, we can build a powerful grassroots movement that can go toe to toe with the millions my opponents have raised from out-of-state donors and special interest lobbyists. That's why my team and I set a daily goal to raise $25,000 by midnight, and we're still falling short. So I'm personally asking: Can you chip in $5 to help me spread my message of a progressive future to voters everywhere? Californians have already began to cast their ballots for the primary election meaning we are officially in the final stretch of this race. Friend, recent polling shows this race is still up for grabs, with over 20% still undecided. But with my opponents bringing in millions that they can use to drown out our grassroots message, I need to make sure I'm hitting my goal each day to stay competitive. Here's the good news: I'm the true progressive in this race. If we can just reach enough California voters with my vision of progress and justice, I'm certain we can build a country that works for all of us. But I can't do it without this movement powering my fight, $5 at a time. Please: Will you give $5 right now so I can hit my $25,000 daily fundraising goal to pull ahead and take the lead in this race?

Listen, I didn\\'t become the most liberal member of the House overnight. This title required years of supporting progressive causes and never once wavering from them even in the face of death threats. I was the only person in Congress to vote against the 60-word resolution that gave President George W. Bush nearly unlimited war powers in the days following 9/11. I\\'ve been an unwavering leader in the fight to make the rich pay their fair share and have introduced legislation with Sen. Bernie Sanders to tax Wall Street.

ENDORSE MY CAMPAIGN FOR PEACE & SECURITY >> But my progressive values don\\'t stop at foreign policy, friend. For years I spearheaded many of the progressive policies that had once been seen as radical and helped them become more mainstream in the Democratic Party.

With just days to go before Election Day, my opponents have decided to spend millions on TV ads to flood the airwaves with their platforms. And to be completely frank with you, I do not have the funds to compete in one of the most expensive media markets in the nation. But I've said this once, and I'll say it again: This race won't be won on TV. That's why I'm focusing on expanding my voter outreach efforts on the ground and I need the help of my top supporters to do just that.

The honest truth is that I'm up against opponents who have enough money in the bank to launch multimillion dollar TV ads. And I just don't have the resources to compete with them in California's insanely expensive media market. But that isn't to say that all hope is lost. Listen, friend, as a Black woman, I always knew that I wouldn't raise the same amount as my opponents. On average, Black women fundraise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But I don't need to raise the most money in this race, because I have a powerful platform that is converting voters. That's why I know we can still do this. My opponents may be flooding the airwaves with TV ads, but that's not the only way to get out the vote. Instead, my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. None of this is cheap. An average yard sign costs about $5. And with 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. But of course, I can't do this alone. There are only 18 days until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $25,000 to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help.

That's why, with only 19 days left until Election Day, I'm stepping up to help send her to the Senate and I would love if you could join me by pitching in now to support her campaign. Barbara Lee has spent a lifetime fighting to advance the issues that truly matter to working families like the one I grew up in. She has taken bold steps to make basic human rights like housing, employment and mental health support a priority, and for that I'm incredibly grateful. But the thing that inspires me most about Rep. Lee's battle-tested progressive record is her longstanding advocacy for criminal justice reform. For years, Barbara Lee has fought to bring issues that had once been labeled as radical to the forefront of the progressive platform such as reforming reentry programs, restoring voting rights to formerly incarcerated people and creating a process forfederal record expungement. Through these reforms, which align closely with my own beliefs on the criminal justice system, Barbara Lee has proven time and time again that she gets things done.She is a candidate who is dedicated to addressing the needs of everyone, from underrepresented communities to working families across California. That's why I know that Congresswoman Barbara Lee is the only person for California's next senator, but she needs our help. Her opponents are spending millions on TV ads to drown out the competition, and she urgently needs more resources to compete.

The latest polls show that nearly 20% of California voters are still undecided, and we can't afford to slow down, not even for a second. This is a make-or-break moment for me, friend, that's why it's so important I hit my daily fundraising goal by midnight. Will you donate $5 or more now to help me get back on track, pull ahead in the polls and build a progressive future in the Senate? Now here's a sad truth: Black women candidates on average raise just one-third as much money as white women (and even less compared to white men) a metric that has become painfully clear in the fundraising deficit in this race. And, while Black women candidates put our campaign contributions to work as efficiently as possible, there are only so many miracles that we can pull off. Friend, there is only one reason why a Black woman with my progressive experience in politics would lose this primary: money. Because I have proven time and time again, in more ways than I can count, that I will never waver in my fight for progress. Even if it means standing alone as the sole dissenting vote against what I know is wrong, I will always use my voice to defend those who have been voiceless for far too long. But I'm not naive, friend. I know that if I don't have the money to compete in this race, I can't pull ahead and I know that as a Black woman, fundraising will always be harder for me. But that doesn't mean that we should give up. Because, as the most progressive and experienced candidate in this race, I know my voice is sorely needed in the Senate. But to get to the finish line in this race, it's absolutely critical that I reach my daily fundraising goal. So I'm turning to my supporters in this difficult moment to ask: Will you rush $5or more anything you can spare to help me reach my daily fundraising goal and help me speak out for progressive values in the Senate? I'm so grateful for your support. Thank you for coming through when it matters most. Barbara Lee - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

But right now, we're pacing behind on fundraising. Friend, if we fall short now, we may have to cut back on how aggressively we're organizing on the ground and I'm trying to do everything in my power to avoid that. That's why I set a fundraising goal to raise $25,000 to get back on track, and I'm counting on you to help me get there.

I know you've already heard: My opponents are spending MILLIONS to flood TV channels with their campaign ads. And to be honest, the California media market is too expensive for me to get my own ads on the air. But that's just fine, because this race won't be decided on TV it'll be determined on the ground. That's why I'm investing heavily in my grassroots operation which means more people to knock on doors, more people to phone bank and more Californians reached with my progressive vision. Friend, this is exactly how we'll pull ahead in this race, but I need your support to keep the momentum going strong. I need to raise$25,000before midnight tonight to help me hit my voter outreach goal, so please: Can I count on you to chip in just $5 to my campaign now to boost this grassroots movement across the finish line?

I\\'ve survived domestic violence. I\\'ve been homeless. I was a single mom. But I never gave up. Ididn\\'t give up when I had to work with the NAACP as a teen to integrate the girls\\' cheerleading squad at my high school. I didn\\'t give up when I couldn\\'t afford child care and had to take my two boys with me to attend my college classes. I didn\\'t give up when I was the only person in Congress who opposed the Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2001.

Friend, I\\'m running for Senate, and I\\'m ready to fight despite the barriers that stand in my way. And I know I can get there, but it\\'ll only happen with the support of people like you. Because the truth is, my opponents have raised millions from their millioniare donors. And while I always knew that I wouldn\\'t raise the most in this race Black women never do Im counting on you to help me raise what I need to pull ahead.

BUT THEN, I was the top vote-getter at the California Democratic Party Endorsement Convention. NOW, with people ALREADY casting their ballots for Californias next senator, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. Here's the thing: As a Black woman, I knew I would never raise the most in this race because on average, Black female candidates raise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But, I don't need to raise the most; I just need to raiseenoughto reach the right voters. And if we do that, we will pull ahead because the polls have made it clear that the more voters learn about me, the more I earn their support. That's why we plan to put every last resource toward expanding our voter outreach and I'm counting on you to help fund these efforts.

I'm proud to say that I have consistently ranked among the most progressive lawmakers in Congress and I'm the most progressive candidate in this race by a long shot. I'm the only candidate in this race who has consistently voted for peace and championed progressive projects such as the Green New Deal, Environmental Justice for All Act, and Medicare for All. Friend, I've spent my entire career fighting for the things that actually matter to working families and that's exactly what I'll continue to do in the Senate. But, with my opponents sitting on millions, I can only get there with the help of this powerful grassroots team.

First of all, I wanted to say thank you. No one believed in my campaign when we first launched. They tried to count us out because we didn't have as much cash on hand as the others in this race, because I have always been fiercely and uncompromisingly progressive, because I didn't look like my opponents. But together, we proved them wrong. We have proved that we can build up a powerful Senate campaign from a small grassroots team and now, we're within striking distance. So here's what we're going to do in these final 27 days. We're going to expand our voter outreach efforts on the ground and reach more voters with my vision for progress and my plan to attain it. And then, when we convert the remaining 20% of undecided voters into voters for progress, we'll advance to the general election! But this plan only works if supporters like you continue to stand by my side in these final days, friend.

And that's exactly what this incredible article by The Nation highlighted: But, while a clear line can be traced through my entire record to prove that I have always been firmly anti-war, my opponents cannot say the same. When our nation was reeling from the tragic 9/11 attacks and President Bush rushed into a war days later, I was the only person in Congress to vote against the Authorization for Use of Military Force. My opponents cannot say this. When the Patriot Act was introduced weeks after 9/11, I voted against the grossly violating bill.My opponents cannot say this. As the military budget continues to bloat year after year, I continuously push to slash Pentagon spending and voted against the last seven annual defense spending bills. My opponents voted for these bills. And when the devastating conflict broke out in Gaza resulting in the loss of well over 25,000 Israeli and Palestinian lives many of them children I was the first candidate to call for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, my opponents' reactions ranged from calls for conditional, temporary pauses to a full throated rejection of US foreign policy. Friend, my record speaks for itself: I will always be a fierce voice for peace, even if it means calling out members of my own party. That's part of why I'm running for Senate because we need more advocates of peace and humanity like me in that chamber of Congress. If you have any money to spare for my Senate campaign,I would be so incredibly humbled if you could make a contribution to my campaign now to help me bring my fight for peace to the Senate.

The honest truth is that I'm up against opponents who have enough money in the bank to launch multimillion dollar TV ads. And I just don't have the resources to compete with them in California's insanely expensive media market. But that isn't to say that all hope is lost. Listen, friend, as a Black woman, I always knew that I wouldn't raise the same amount as my opponents. On average, Black women fundraise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But I don't need to raise the most money in this race, because I have a powerful platform that is converting voters. That's why I know we can still do this.

Instead, my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. None of this is cheap. An average yard sign costs about $5. And with 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. But of course, I can't do this alone. There are only 31 days until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes.

Images of Representative Lee: as an infant, as a school cheerleader, and as a young woman I was born in El Paso, Texas, via an emergency forceps delivery. My mother's pregnancy wasn't particularly dangerous but because she was initially denied admission to the hospital while in active labor due to the color of her skin, we both nearly died. Throughout my childhood, my family and I continued to be treated as lesser. My father was a lieutenant colonel and my mother served as the first Black clerical worker in Fort Bliss and still, despite all the service they provided for our nation, we were judged by the color of our skin. But, while my parents couldn't control how the world treated me, theycouldcontrol how I was taught to treat the world. So they taught me to keep my chin high and never settle for less than I deserved. When I was just 15 after we moved from the deeply segregated South to California I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But I didn't look like the kind of person the selection committee would choose for the all-white girls cheer team. So I partnered with the NAACP and became my school'sfirstBlack girl cheerleader. I then went on to become the president of Mills College's Black Student Union, where I had the honor of meeting our nation's first Black congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm. She took one look at me a young single mother who was so passionate about getting an education that I even took my boys with me to class when I couldn't afford child care and knew that I would one day create the change that women like me needed. I heeded Rep. Chisholm's words and registered to vote, thus beginning a long journey that ended in Washington, D.C. And when I saw the opportunity to represent California's 12th Congressional District, I put my head down and worked hard winning the special election and following in Shirley Chisholm's footsteps. Now, I'm the only Black woman in the California Senate primary and I'm ready to take the experience, struggles and voice of Black women to the Senate. Friend, with just 32 days to go until the election, the latest polls show this race is wide open.So please, to help me leave my mark, build a progressive future that works for all and become our nation's fourth Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate: Can I count on you to chip in $5 or more now so that Black women can have a voice in the Senate for years to come?

From working with the local NAACP to desegregate my girls cheerleading squad at San Fernando High School to being the only member of Congress to vote against the Afghanistan war, I've never stopped fighting for what's right. Now, I'm the only Black woman in the California Senate primary and if I win this race, I'll take the experience, struggles and voice of Black women to the Senate.But the hard reality is that Black women candidates fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do. That's why my team and I set an ambitious goal to raise $100,000 before our crucial end-of-month deadline but with just one day left to hit this goal, we're falling dangerously short. So please, with this being our FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out, I have to ask:Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? The challenges our country is facing from economic injustice to attacks on our reproductive freedom require bold, progressive solutions. I'm ready to deliver for all people, but I need your help. With 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. That's why my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. Listen, there are only 35 days left until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $100,000 online before the month ends to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help. So I'm humbly asking, to give my bid for Senate the best possible chance: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? Now is the time to dig deep so we can turn out as many voters as possible for primary day. I can't do this without you, so thank you for your support.

I truly cannot afford to fall even a penny short, but here's where things stand: Friend, as someone who has continuously been ranked as one of the most progressive members of Congress, I can bring about the change that we deserve in the Senate. I can be the additional vote we need to finally abolish the filibuster, address economic injustice and pass crucial legislation like restoring abortion access nationwide. But I'm up against opponents who are sitting on MILLIONS, and if I don't get more resources ASAP, they may drown me out. Polling shows that as many as 20% of California voters are still undecided just over a month out from election day, so this is truly still anyone's race. That's why I'm focusing all of my efforts on expanding my voter outreach efforts on the ground. But if I miss this fundraising goal my FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out I'll have to make tough decisions, like pulling back our efforts to reach California voters. Friend, this close to election day, every choice we each make is incredibly impactful. It could be your $5 donation that helps us knock on just enough doors, call just enough voters or run just enough ads to push this campaign and our movement across the finish line. Please, will you rush $5 or more right now to help me reach enough voters and build a progressive future for all of us? Thank you for standing with me in this fight.

The most recent polling shows this race is wide open, with a large number of voters still undecided. The pundits are saying we have a path as long as we reach our voters and galvanize our base. I'm at a serious fundraising deficit compared to my opponents and I need every dollar to close this gap. We're picking up steam, but with every day I don't hit my goal, I have to raise twice as much the next day to catch up. Running a campaign in California is expensive and political experts are saying this could be the most competitive Senate race in U.S. history. With two other candidates in this race sitting on millions, missing my goal could spell disaster for this campaign. Grassroots supporters like you are propelling this campaign to monumental heights. And this grassroots team is the reason political pundits across the board are saying this race is wide open. So here I am, writing to you again, friend. I know you hear a lot from me, but it's only because I trust you and believe that I can't do this without you. Please, if you can spare any donation before my end-of-month deadline in 2 days to close our fundraising gap, it would mean the world to me.

So please: Can I count on you to donate $5 or more to my Senate campaign now? Friend, I'll be blunt: I do not have the resources it takes to compete for TV space in California. My opponents are spending MILLIONS on flooding the airwaves, and any ads I could afford to launch would be drowned out immediately. But this race won't be won on TV. It'll be won on the ground and I just happen to have one of the most impressive grassroots operations in the state. That's why, in these final days, I'm heavily investing in meeting voters where they are. That means more lawn signs, more rallies, more door knockers and more phone bankers.

Your $5 end-of-month donation will help us reach those last voters with my progressive platform and record in these critical last days.

And, if it inspires you, I'd appreciate it if you would make a donation to my historic campaign for Senate. When I was 15, after making the move from the deeply segregated South to California, I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But unfortunately, I didn't look like the kind of person that the selection committee would choose for the cheerleading team. I could've just accepted my fate and given up there but that's not the kind of person my mother, who was one of just 12 students to integrate her college, raised me to be. So instead, I partnered with the NAACP and despite pushback from the school administration, we were able to convince them to change the system from a selection process to an election process that would allow the whole school to vote. After trying out in front of the entire student body, guess what? I won. I became the first Black girl cheerleader at my school. And even better, other girls of color took advantage of the new process and were able to become cheerleaders that year as well. Barbara Lee proudly posing in her cheerleader uniform after successfully organizing the integration of her high school cheerleading team with the help of the NAACP. You see, friend, I've been working to break down barriers and dismantle unfair systems since I was just 15 years old and I'm nowhere near done yet. That's why I'm running for Senate and I hope I can count on you to join me. On average, Black women fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do, so I truly need every dollar.

I spent 20 years of my youth serving and fighting endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ukraine isnt in our national security interests to send billions of dollars to them. Furthermore, we cant afford it. We are $34T in debt. We have our own wide open border. It is irresponsible to the constitution and Americans to fund Ukraine. This is a wake-up call for the world and the US. I urge all European countries to shoulder greater responsibility for their own security. Why cant they go $34T in debt for Ukraine? Why does America have to go into more debt? Europe relies too much on America and American military deterrence. European countries need to step it up and spend their money to help secure their continent. While Pete was in Europe glad handing with Zelenskyy and embarrassing us all on the world stage, I was in Jackson, Nebraska meeting with Nebraskans about what they care about and its clear they dont support funding Ukraine. They want our border secured first. Their priorities are my priorities.

My background is a big part of the reason I remain grounded and focused on defending our Montana way of life. Because with all the chaos in Washington (especially now), you need somebody who will roll up their sleeves and get to work. Last time I ran, nearly $70 million was spent on the Montana Senate race. This time around, weve already passed that number: an eye-popping $120 million has been spent or reserved in advertising alone. Itll take a lot of support from this team to raise what well need to protect this seat. And if you know me, Im not the kind of person who likes to ask for money. But I bet Mitch McConnell would be furious if we showed him that a whole lot of grassroots power is stronger than his wealthy donors and super PACs will ever be.

Republican efforts to prioritize hearings for these initiatives have been unanimously rejected by House Democrats, while bills granting extensive influence to the Attorney General over fiscal notes for alternative initiatives have received swift attention.

Allow me to introduce myself and share a little bit about why Im running for the U.S. Senate. My work in Congress has always been defined by who I am and where I come from. I grew up in a working-class family; my mom was a public school teacher and my dad was a salesman for Trans World Airlines. When I was 11, my dad moved the family to start a working farm. My brothers and I carried much of the load, collecting eggs, cleaning hog pens and chicken houses, and all the other work a farm requires. It was tough, but the farm taught us the value of hard work, determination, and persistence. When our family fell on hard times, my father filed for bankruptcy and we lost the farm. From that point on, I learned there's no shame in asking for help but there is in not helping. Thats why Im running for Senate to bring Marylanders together to solve big problems like the opioid crisis, criminal justice reform, and mental health. But no one runs for office alone so Ill need folks like you involved every step of the way.

[\",\n  'Angus King for U.S. Senate Campaign [ Friends Nearly two years ago, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in a heartbreaking, unprovoked attack on a democratic nation. He thought the war would be over quickly and that the free world would watch and do nothing. He was wrong. The Ukrainian people came together to bravely hold the line against Putin, and America and our allies around the world stood strong alongside them. Together with the Ukrainians and their impressive President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, we sent a loud and clear message that we will stand united against authoritarians who threaten democracy anywhere in the globe. Two years later, we are still fighting a battle for the soul of democracy in the world. Thats why I recently voted in support of a bipartisan bill to aid Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan in defending themselves. Let me be clear: Authoritarian tyrants like Putin must be stopped, not appeased. If history has taught us anything, its that we cannot simply walk away from the battle for freedom and democracy. Remember when Hitler swept through Europe, and the free world waited too long to stop him? If we allow Putin to overtake a sovereign nation, do we really expect him to stop there? Or continue eastward in a bloody campaign against a NATO nation when America would be compelled to send our men and women into a fight? We know Putin is out to remake the Soviet Union in his image we know this because he has said so! Abandoning Ukraines fight for sovereignty would be one of the biggest mistakes our country could make. Its something that would haunt us for generations. Thats why I remain more committed than ever to working toward bipartisan efforts to confront authoritarianism and defend democracy. This war is costing America only arms and ammunition; its costing Ukrainians the lives of their loved ones. Thank you for being a part of this fight. Together, we can continue the work of helping the Ukrainian people defend themselves and uphold democracy across the globe.

Last month, Angus introduced bipartisan legislation, the Combat Veterans Pre-Enrollment Act, to help combat veterans sign up for VA health benefits before they officially transition out of active duty, to make sure they never have a gap in coverage. Angus also introduced bipartisan legislation, the Paid Family and Medical Leave Tax Credit Extension and Enhancement Act, to help states across the country follow Maines lead in expanding paid family and medical leave options. On the floor of the Senate last week, Angus gave a speech spotlighting the urgency of continuing to support Ukraines fight for freedom against the Russian invasion and has continued educating Americans [ about the historic imperative of helping democratic allies defend themselves. Angus also co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to help bolster the American workforce by retaining more of our countrys STEM graduates. The Keep Stem Talent Act of 2023 would remove green card caps for graduates in key STEM fields who have an American job offer. This is the kind of tangible progress your support is driving and with your help, well ensure Angus stays in the Senate fighting for us. Thank you, again, for all you do. Onward!

Then, if youre able, I hope youll make a contribution to my re-election campaign to help me keep up my fight for Maine people in the Senate. [ Long story short: Think of a yardstick. Let me explain. My very first job out of law school brought me to Skowhegan, a small town of less than 8,000 residents back then. I worked for Pine Tree Legal Assistance, helping provide free legal aid for low-income people. Not long into my time there, I realized just how many challenges the families I helped faced. It seemed like people would come into my office with three feet of problems, but the legal aid I provided could solve only about five inches of the issues my clients struggled with. On top of that, these families were worried about everything from education to health care to transportation all challenges that come with living in poverty. I wanted a way I could help people solve issues that were on the whole yardstick, not just the few inches I could deal with as a lawyer. Then, when Maine voters elected me to my first term as governor in 1994, I finally got my chance. I dedicated all my effort to creating jobs, reigniting Maines economy, reforming our state mental health services, pursuing common-sense environmental protections, and more. Now in my role as senator, I can do even more to help people in Maine and across the country tackle the issues further up their yardstick. Ive committed myself to working to improve the prospects for all Maine people, protect our national security interests, build a stronger democracy, and safeguard our environment for future generations. Its the most important job of my career, and Id be honored to continue my work building bipartisan consensus for the challenges facing our nation but I cant do it without you, friend. So if youre able, can you chip in a donation of $10 or any amount to support my re-election campaign? Im here on behalf of people like you, and I promise to continue to work hard for you in the days and weeks ahead. [ If you've saved your payment information with FastAction, your donation will go through immediately: CHIP IN $10 NOW [ CHIP IN $25 NOW [ CHIP IN $50 NOW [ CHIP IN $100 NOW [ CHIP IN $250 NOW [ ANOTHER AMOUNT [ I am incredibly grateful for all your support know that I will continue to work to build a better Maine, every inch of the way up that yardstick.

[ ADD YOUR NAME [ In recent years, Congress has seen the passage of a number of significant bipartisan successes. From the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the CHIPS and Science Act to bolster the American economy, to the PACT Act that expanded veterans' health care and benefits, I fought to turn these bills into laws that actually help working people and families. As an Independent, I take pride in finding common ground with my colleagues in Congress, ensuring we move beyond arguments and political theater. Im not in this fight for personal gain, media attention, or headlines. Im in the Senate because, at the end of the day, I have seven grandchildren, and Im working to help create a better future for them and the generations that come after. Its not easy being an independent voice in Washington: it means having to work even harder to grow this grassroots team, but I wouldnt trade it for anything.

Ive spent my life fighting for the Dignity of Work and I meanallwork. Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, earn a salary or make tips, are raising children or caring for an aging parent, Ill fight for you. Im running for reelection so I cankeepfighting for workers and families in the Senate but I need your help. Analysts atCNNsay Im one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot and national Republicans are already launching attack ads against me. The battle for Senate control could all come down to Ohio so please, Im personally asking:Will you chip in $5 or more now so we can win in Ohio and defend the Senate? I grew up in Mansfield, Ohio, in a community of ironworkers, carpenters, autoworkers, and electricians. Im fighting in the Senate every day to bring those jobs back, to build our economy by investing in the middle class, and to ensure hard work pays off for every American. But Im facing my toughest race yet in a state Donald Trump won by 8 points. In 2022, the Ohio Senate race was one of the most costly and competitive in the nation, andNBC Newsreports that this one could be even nastier and more expensive. The long and short of it is, I cant win and Democrats simply cant hold onto our narrow Senate majority if we dont have strong grassroots support from folks like you. Thats why Im asking for your support today, Jenga: Please, will you chip in $5 or more now so we can win in Ohio and defend the Senate?

As one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection, I can\\'t stress enough how important your support is in this critical moment.

My Republican rivals can write their own campaign checks, but I\\'m relying on grassroots support to hit my $250,000 goal before the upcoming deadline.

YOU have grassroots power, and together, we ARE grassroots power. Will you join me in supporting Senator Brown with a donation of $5, or whatever you can afford? Heres why Sherrod is worthy of your support. When I was growing up, my mom taught speech in public school, and my dad was a firefighter. They taught me the value of hard work, and most importantly, the dignity of work. Today, Im still a proud member of three unions. Im inspired by Sherrods campaign because he\\'s a proven champion for workers\\' rights. Hes spent his life in the trenches advocating for everything from higher wages to the right to unionize. And Sherrod has always been a fearless leader at the forefront of protecting civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights, and reproductive rights. Sherrod will always stand up for working families like the one in which I grew up. Thats why Im asking you to use your grassroots power to make sure that a significant majority of Buckeye Staters turn out and vote to keep him in the U.S. Senate. Will you donate right now to keep our dignity of work champion Sherrod Brown in the U.S. Senate? Sherrod has run on these issues and won elections in the past, but Ohio has become increasingly challenging for a Democrat to win statewide. Sherrod is one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Ohios race for his seat could decide Senate control. Jenga, with Republicans getting millions of dollars from billionaires who pay less in taxes than American workers do, grassroots power is the most effective way to keep Sherrod Brown as our champion in the Senate and ensure that our hopes, our dreams, and our rights are the law of the land. So please, will you join me RIGHT NOW in chipping in $5, or whatever you can afford, to reelect Sherrod in Ohio so he can continue fighting for working families across the country? Thank you so much for being engaged in this fight. Your support really matters. We can do this!

THEN : Mitch McConnells allies came out in full support of the hedge fund executive, a mega-millionaire who is the daughter of the last Republican Senator to represent New Mexico.

But playing football was never my only dream from a young age I knew I wanted to help people. So I became a civil rights attorney to defend what I believe is our most fundamental right: the right to vote. I proudly served in President Obamas administration before I came home to Dallas, where Im now raising my family. *I ran for Congress because I wanted more kids in North Texas to have the opportunity to achieve their version of the American dream and protect the fundamental values of our democracy and I beat the odds to defeat an 11-term Republican incumbent, helping Democrats flip the House blue in 2018. * *Now, Im ready for my next challenge:* taking on Ted Cruz. I know it wont be easy, but I also know that Texans deserve so much better than Ted Cruzs cynical partisan politics. *Everything Ted Cruz does is for Ted Cruz when Im in the Senate, everything I do will be to help people like you.

That document has come to represent the importance of expanding rights and representation. Its my proof of where we come from and its my inspiration for where we need to go.

The Team Emord petition drive is in full swing. Across the Commonwealth, 160 volunteers trained in the gathering process by our Petition Director Ann Parker are collecting hundreds of signatures in as many as six venues simultaneously. It is an incredible sight to behold and proof that the Emord campaign has the most extensive grassroots support of any candidate for U.S. Senate. And Team Emord is everywhere! Join our volunteer force; become part of the movement to Save Virginia and Save America. Contact Ann Parker at ann@emordforva.com This past week, on January 15, Jonathan received an enthusiastic reception and strong support at the Bell Tower on the Capitol grounds, speaking to members and supporters of Virginia Medical Freedom Alliance. Endorsed by the 750,000 strong Stand for Health Freedom, Jonathan pledged to introduce legislation to ban all mask and vaccine mandates and to compel all federally funded hospitals, police departments, fire departments, and the military to rehire and re-enlist those forced out by the mandates, give them back pay, and the promotions otherwise due them. The speech received rave reviews and came on the one-year anniversary of his original announcement of his Emord for Senate exploration from that very same spot. [image: Virginia Medical Freedom Alliance] < On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Williamsburg Breakfast Club to an enthusiastically supportive reception. This is his third appearance before the Club and members know him well and like him well too. On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Newport News GOP. Once again, the support for Emord for Senate was incredible. On January 17, Jonathan was interviewed by Joe Thomas of WCHV in Charlottesville. He discussed Kaines voting record of support for inflationary spending, open borders, and woke policies in the schools. Jonathan explained that Virginia and the nation must reverse course or face years more of ruin from the Biden/Kaine far left agenda. On January 17, Jonathan spoke before the Yorktown Breakfast Club. Members asked questions and Jonathan delighted those in attendance with his characteristic direct and detailed responses, revealing the breadth of his understanding, experience, and legal and persuasive skills. Several mentioned to the Team that they could not wait for Jonathan to debate Kaine. On January 17, Jonathan signed copies of his books and spoke to patrons at the Book Owl Bookstore in Portsmouth, Virginia. Members of the public were intrigued to learn of Jonathans agenda and many expressed strong support. On January 18, Jonathan addressed the Newport Breakfast Club. Once again, members asked probing questions and enjoyed hearing Jonathan reveal not only clear mastery of a wide range of subjects but also detailed legislative solutions to the problems facing the nation. As in each location before, the support for Emord for Senate is very strong in Newport News. On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by Dr. Jason Dean on Brave TV. They discussed the disastrous open border policy and the union between Biden, Kaine, and globalists intent on destroying the American republic and replacing it with a totalitarian global government. On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show, as he is every Thursday. They discussed the pressing issues of the day. On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by TNT Radio on its State of the Nation live broadcast. Jonathan explained in detail his agenda for saving Virginia and America and received the on air endorsements of the programs two hosts. On January 18, Jonathan spoke before the Gloucester County Republican Committee. Members repeatedly advised the campaign of their support for Emord for Senate as the sweep across Virginia continues. On January 19, Jonathan was interviewed on Newsmax by host Rob Carson. < Jonathan explained his position on the J-6ers, reiterating that only those for whom there is direct evidence of violence or property destruction should be prosecuted. The vast majority should be immediately released. He explained that he will introduce legislation to grant immediate release and amnesty to those wrongfully arrested and incarcerated. No one should be jailed, let alone placed in solitary confinement, whose only crime may have been trespass. That is an abuse of prosecutorial discretion and proof that Justice has been perverted to attack Democrats political opponents. On January 20 and 21, Jonathan joined Team Emord at the Salem Gun Show, joining them in defending our 2nd Amendment rights. The Team interacted with hundreds of patrons and strong patriots. Jonathan will sponsor legislation to establish constitutional carry nationwide to end state and local efforts to deprive Americans of their right to keep and bear arms. THE CLOCK IS TICKING Our campaign to raise $50,000 by the January 31 deadline is underway. Donate what you can! Help get us past the finish line. Only days left. The clock is ticking.
