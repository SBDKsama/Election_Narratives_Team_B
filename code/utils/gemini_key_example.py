# Summary:
# The `gemini_key_example.py` file serves as a template for users to enter their Gemini API key.

# Description:
# - This file contains a single line of code where a variable `gemini_key` is assigned a placeholder string.
# - Users are expected to replace 'FILL_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with their actual Gemini API key to authenticate and use the Gemini services.
# - This approach separates sensitive information from the main codebase, allowing users to configure their API keys without modifying core scripts.
# - It likely supports the `gemini.py` script by providing the necessary configuration to connect to the Gemini API.

gemini_key = 'FILL_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
