There are simple gun safety reforms that we knowwillcurb gun violence and make our communities safer. The vast majority of Americans support basic reforms like expanded background checks. Gun safety legislation shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's about protecting communities and preventing senseless deaths. But the far-right gun lobby is spending MILLIONS each year to stop commonsense legislation from becoming the law of the land. And each year, the cycle of mass shootings and violence continues. That's why Democrats are fighting to finally make a change and pass universal background checks!

From launching this campaign last year on January 6 to calling out Josh Hawley on cable news to breaking Missouri fundraising records quarter after quarter, your support has helped us put a national spotlight on this U.S. Senate race. And now, multiple polls are showing that were in a neck-and-neck race with Josh Hawley the GOPs most unpopular U.S. Senator running in 2024.

But first, please let me share a little more about how we got here.

I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, times had never been tougher. But we werent alone our community took care of us. When my parents had to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat. Thats the Missouri I grew up in. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1004 ]Photos of Lucas in uniform. Their support helped send me to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything they had done for me and my family growing up. Got deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Later the Pentagon. I was on the Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia. When I came home between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest things was seeing what was happening back in my old neighborhood. It was a community picked for parts the local corner store boarded up, my first family house bulldozed to the ground. Heres all thats left of it: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1005 ]The empty lot where Lucas' childhood home once stood. While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies for the industries that stripped our communities for parts like Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil and then told us they cant figure out how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and investing in our own people. I saw what was happening and I was ready to fight back. So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an organization that fights corporate monopolies we took on defense contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind. And now, Im running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and fundamentally change who has power in our country so everyday people call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a Marshall Plan for the Midwest a massive investment and job creation program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil fuels once and for all. I want to codify Roe v. Wade, secure voting rights, and ban anti-union Right-to-Work scams forever. I want to put working people in charge of our country. But I need your help to get it done. Without a single cent of corporate PAC money, were building the people-powered movement thats going to defeat Josh Hawley and flip this Senate seat and I need you on our team.

Josh Hawley is vulnerable.

But I need you on this team to get it done, Jenga. GOP insiders and even Hawleys own campaign have already started attacking me and over the coming months, theyre bound to get even more vicious. Thats why we need to start preparing right now to fight back and deliver our positive message to voters.

And, if it inspires you, I'd appreciate it if you would make a donation to my historic campaign for Senate. When I was 15, after making the move from the deeply segregated South to California, I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But unfortunately, I didn't look like the kind of person that the selection committee would choose for the cheerleading team. I could've just accepted my fate and given up there but that's not the kind of person my mother, who was one of just 12 students to integrate her college, raised me to be. So instead, I partnered with the NAACP and despite pushback from the school administration, we were able to convince them to change the system from a selection process to an election process that would allow the whole school to vote. After trying out in front of the entire student body, guess what? I won. I became the first Black girl cheerleader at my school. And even better, other girls of color took advantage of the new process and were able to become cheerleaders that year as well. Barbara Lee proudly posing in her cheerleader uniform after successfully organizing the integration of her high school cheerleading team with the help of the NAACP. You see, friend, I've been working to break down barriers and dismantle unfair systems since I was just 15 years old and I'm nowhere near done yet. That's why I'm running for Senate and I hope I can count on you to join me. On average, Black women fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do, so I truly need every dollar. Please, will you donate whatever you can spare to my Senate campaign so I can build a progressive future for all? Thank you for listening to my story.

It is, of course, a uniquely American problem, and it wasnt always like this. Barely a year after Sandy Hook, the gun-death rate for children started to sky rocket. Today, for the first time in our history, guns outpace car accidents as the leading cause of death for children in America. For most of your life and mine, car accidents have been the number one cause of death. What changed? With changes in laws and safety standards and innovation from the government and the car industry, the number of deaths fell significantly. This is why so many of us as parents worry every day. How is it possible that so many of my colleagues and the gun lobby look at these numbers and trends and allow it to continue? And more than that, they fan the flames with fear mongering all in the name of selling more guns. How can we choose to do nothing when we know there are popular, commonsense ideas that can save lives? And lets be clear: it is a choice. But I will not stand by and let Washington ignore the daily carnage of this epidemic, and I cannot do this alone. If you are with me in this fight, will you please contribute any amount you can afford today to send a powerful message to demand change? Every dollar will help me build a movement with the power to change our gun laws and save lives. CONTRIBUTE: Together, weve proven that our movement is far more powerful than the NRA.

Its because of thousands of grassroots supporters like you that we can hit the ground running this election year. Now, with 2024 officially in full swing, your continued support is more important than ever. Please believe me when I say that this year, the stakes are higher than ever before. We must hold the Senate majority so we can win these key fights: The fight for our democracy and voting rights, for womens rights, for workers rights. The fight to lower costs. The fight for economic freedom for workers. The fight for children, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. If my opponent wins this seat, Democrats will lose our Senate majority and put all these fights at risk. We cannot afford a GOP Senate majority, Jenga. Its that simple. I will never back down from these fights, but I need your help. Will you make a donation to fuel the fight against my mega-millionaire opponent? Between now and November, its going to take all of us working together to defend our Senate majority. Theres a tsunami of dark money heading our way from Mitch McConnell, my mega-millionaire opponent, and all the right-wing groups that are waiting in the wings to flip PA red. To fight back, Im counting on grassroots supporters chipping in $5 at a time or whatever they can spare. I would be honored to have your support to defend this seat in one of this years most competitive and expensive Senate races on the map.

        "content_plain": "< Jenga , I came to America legally as a refugee and I paid this country back for its generosity with 25 years of service in Navy Special Operations. But today, we have tens of thousands of illegal aliens from all over the world, entering our country every day. Syria. Iran. China. Yemen. Haiti. Nigeria. They are military-aged men who hate America. The Biden-Kaine Democrats are doing nothing to stop the flow. In fact, their open border policies serve as a Welcome to America sign, and heres their endgame: They want illegal immigrants to vote. They know theyll vote Democrat. And thats their ticket to a permanent majority and the unchecked control and power they crave. Heres my message to those who wish to come to the United States: Dont ask for the American Dream if you dont embrace the American laws and the American culture I DID. Friend, your contribution is hard at work taking our message across the Commonwealth. With less than 10 months until our Election Day showdown with career politician Tim Kaine, we need to up our game, and your continued support is urgently needed to bring home our victory. Heres our goal: Raise $30,000 in just 8 days. Can I count on your help to get there? < SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN TODAY < Friend, we MUST start this year strong, because the D.C. Democrats know that Tim Kaine is vulnerable and wildly out-of-touch with Virginians, so they will pour tens of millions of dollars into this race to prop him up and win majority control of the U.S. Senate. A shocking eight million illegal immigrants have come into our country during Joe Bidens watch. Thats nearly the population of the Commonwealth of Virginia! Its insanity! More than 100,000 overdose deaths occurred last year from fentanyl trafficked through Mexico. Thats roughly the population of Roanoke. Its an absolute tragedy! And a completely preventable one at that! While the streets are saturated with this opioid-poison, President Biden has seen fit to commute the sentences of convicted meth and crack cocaine dealers. Bidens soft-on-crime policies are wreaking havoc and ruining lives. Career politician Tim Kaine is along for the ride. Senator Tim Kaine votes the Biden way nearly every time. With Joe Biden in the White House, the world is on fire and the southern border is burning. Meanwhile Liberal Tim Kaine is offering his friend a match. Friend, we are losing our country. We cant let that happen. Thats why Im running for Senate . . . continuing my service after 25 years in the U.S. Navy . . . after deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia . . . after seeing what the Biden-Kaine Democrats are doing to this great country. Theyve turned our border into a war zone! We must build the wall. We must use advanced technology to repel the illegal alien invasion. We must reinstate Trumps Remain in Mexico policy for this reason: IT WORKS! Its time for new leadership in Washington, D.C. and its time for Biden and Kaine to go. < < < < < <m not done fighting for America. And I know you arent either! < SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN TODAY < I cant thank you enough for your generous support. Its inspiring. Its strengthening. Its already making a powerful difference because our campaign is making progress daily. But as I said, its time to up our game. Knowing that Washington, D.C.-financed Tim Kaine is going into full attack mode, our campaign must find a way to raise $30,000 in the next 8 days. Our campaign is aggressive because it must be. Were taking our anti-Biden message to all 95 counties and 39 independent cities. Were taking our anti-open border, anti-fentanyl message to all 8.7 million Virginians in 3.3 million households. With your ongoing support, well take Politician Tim Kaine to task for his nearly 100% pro-Biden voting record with Virginias seniors, veterans, farmers, small business owners, professionals, factory workers, and gun owners. Weve got a lot to do . . . and Election Day is less than 10 months away. Weve got a lot to raise . . . $30,000 and just 8 days to do it. Weve got the U.S. Senate to flip . . . and our victory here in Virginia will do it! Your generous contribution will be a welcome sight at our headquarters. Friend, I hope you can help. SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN TODAY < God Bless Virginia and America, < CAPT Hung Cao, USN (Ret) P.S. Thank goodness for elections! Thats the day We the People are in charge. This year, the Biden-Kaine duo are in deep trouble. Theyve failed and the citizens of our Commonwealth know it. Our mission is a clear one: To take back our country.Your help < is vital.

        "content_plain": "Friend, can we talk about the state of this race for a moment? I'm ready to lay all my cards out. The honest truth is that I'm up against opponents who have enough money in the bank to launch multimillion dollar TV ads. And I just don't have the resources to compete with them in California's insanely expensive media market. But that isn't to say that all hope is lost. Listen, friend, as a Black woman, I always knew that I wouldn't raise the same amount as my opponents. On average, Black women fundraise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But I don't need to raise the most money in this race, because I have a powerful platform that is converting voters. That's why I know we can still do this. My opponents may be flooding the airwaves with TV ads, but that's not the only way to get out the vote. Instead, my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. None of this is cheap. An average yard sign costs about $5. And with 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. But of course, I can't do this alone. There are only 31 days until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $25,000 to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help. So I'm humbly asking, to give my bid for Senate the best possible chance: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? Now is the time to dig deep so we can show wealthy elites that we CAN build a strong campaign from a grassroots team. Thank you, Barbara Lee - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

As a public school teacher, she taught me to value education; although I excelled in sports, homework always came first in our house. A lot of the policies I'm fighting for now affordable child care, universal pre-k, more support and opportunities for our kids are informed by the tough choices I watched her make while I was growing up. My world was small growing up. I don't remember traveling much farther than Brownsville, where my grandparents lived. But my love of reading and the strong community I found at our local YMCA made it feel bigger. I had a lot of support along the way to earn a full football scholarship to Baylor and eventually make it to the NFL I think that's what makes me so committed to fighting for today's kids. I don't want my story to be the exception; I want every kid to be supported and empowered to succeed. My wife, Aly, and our two boys inspire me to work harder and dream bigger every day. When we decided to have kids, I knew from day one that I wanted to be there for every moment, and I wanted us to be equal partners. That's a big part of what inspired me to become the first member of Congress to take paternity leave and make fighting for paid family leave a key priority. I'm telling you all this because it's all a big part of why I'm running for Senate to fight for families like yours and mine. And, yes, as a fourth-generation Texan, I'm also sick and tired of watching Ted Cruz trample over our rights and embarrass the Lone Star State every chance he gets. Friend, I know Texans are ready for change, and I've taken down guys a lot tougher than Ted Cruz before. But I need your help. Experts are calling Texas a battleground state, saying this could be one of the most competitive and most expensive races this cycle. It's going to take a historic outpouring of grassroots support to beat Ted Cruz, and I don't want to risk losing because we didn't have the resources we needed. So I'm personally asking, will you chip in $5 today to help me defeat Ted Cruz and be the senator Texas families deserve? Any amount you can spare is truly appreciated Thank you so much, Colin Allred - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com. To unsubscribe from this email list, please click here:"

DONATE: If youre asking why this matters, I want you to think about all thats at stake. I dont need to rehash the horrors of Trumps four years in the Oval Office. Im sure you remember it well. But if he returns, there will be even fewer checks and balances in place. Trump is fully surrounded by the most extreme parts of the Republican Party. Anybody who cared about norms or institutions is gone. Hes got a hand-picked Supreme Court majority thats proven they are just right-wing political actors in robe. Hes going to try to extinguish any hope we have left for democracy. He proved that to all of us on January 6th. Hes on the campaign trail bragging every day about how insane his agenda is. He wants full credit for overturning Roe v. Wade, and we know he will ban abortion nationwide overruling even blue states if he can. After this months school shooting in Iowa, he told people they needed to get over it. Donald Trump doesnt care about the daily carnage of guns in this country because its just the price of the gun lobbys guns everywhere agenda. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has spent three years delivering as much progress as possible a gun safety bill, climate action, infrastructure, lower drug prices, and the list goes on. His record is unmatched as the most consequential president of our lifetime. Im all-in on this fight for our democracy and our future. Im going to do everything I can to reelect Joe, and I am asking you to join me: Please split a contribution between Joe Bidens campaign and my reelection right now. Its important that we have as many people pitching in as possible as we prepare to kickoff the general election. DONATE: Look, you know Im not one for false alarms or doomsday messages. But politics is not a game for me. The stakes are far too real and far too high for all of us in one way or another. This is the reality in 2024, but we each have the choice to decide what were going to do about it. Thank you in advance for pitching in.

In case youre opening one of my emails for the very first time, Im Eric Hansen: Proud businessman, father, husband, and now candidate for the U.S. Senate. I believe our country and our state arent living up to their full potential, and frankly - Im pretty angry about it. * Im angry that Delaware schools are ranked 48th in the nation. * Im angry that Delaware ranks 5th in opioid and fentanyl deaths. * Im angry that upon release, 60% of Delaware criminals are back in prison within 3 years. Only one state is worse. * Im angry that Delaware is ranked 48th for government integrity, transparency, and accountability. * Im angry that politicians in Washington, D.C. care more about their careers than their constituents. * Im angry that at every level of governance, our leaders put partisan politics over whats best for the people. Enough is enough. Im running for Senate to do something about it - about all of it. I see where we could be as a state - and as a country - and it makes me angry to see how often we fall short. Knowing that 9 times out of 10 its because of partisan politics and personal egos only makes it worse. Now, observers and consultants will say a Republican doesnt have a chance at winning a Senate seat in Delaware. Theyll say Delawareans will never support someone with an R after their name. Theyll say sensible Republican candidates dont exist. Well, Im here to prove them wrong. If youre angry about where weve fallen short as a state and as a nation, then Im asking you to join me.

From working with the local NAACP to desegregate my girls cheerleading squad at San Fernando High School to being the only member of Congress to vote against the Afghanistan war, I've never stopped fighting for what's right. Now, I'm the only Black woman in the California Senate primary and if I win this race, I'll take the experience, struggles and voice of Black women to the Senate.But the hard reality is that Black women candidates fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do. That's why my team and I set an ambitious goal to raise $100,000 before our crucial end-of-month deadline but with just one day left to hit this goal, we're falling dangerously short. So please, with this being our FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out, I have to ask:Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? The challenges our country is facing from economic injustice to attacks on our reproductive freedom require bold, progressive solutions. I'm ready to deliver for all people, but I need your help. With 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. That's why my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. Listen, there are only 35 days left until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $100,000 online before the month ends to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help. So I'm humbly asking, to give my bid for Senate the best possible chance: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? Now is the time to dig deep so we can turn out as many voters as possible for primary day. I can't do this without you, so thank you for your support.

Brian is an Air Force veteran, trauma surgeon, and a member of the team Murphy family. Just like so many in our movement, the issue of gun violence found him. In 2016, he rose to national attention when he led the team that operated on Dallas police officers who were shot during a peaceful protest against police brutality. Three died on his watch when they were there trying to protect young people exercising their rights. And it is Brians voice, as a Black trauma surgeon, that broke through as a community grieved and tried to make sense of what happened. In 2022, Chris hired him to join our fight to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He worked tirelessly to help us break the gun lobbys 30-year grip on Congress, and now hes taking on his next mission running for the open-seat in TX-32. Please split a donation between Dr. Brian Williams campaign and our reelection today to help us grow our gun safety movements power in Congress. CONTRIBUTE: Brian will bring an important perspective and voice to Congress. He knows what it is like to have to tell a parent their child wont survive. He also understands what its like to operate on an expecting mother experiencing a deadly pregnancy complication. He brings a powerful frontline experience, and he will help our movement build power in Washington to end gun violence, restore abortion rights, and deliver real progress for working families. But hes going to face his first test at the ballot box in just 30 days. This is an important test of our movements strength, so we need to do all we can to make sure he has the resources to win. If you can, please split a contribution between Dr. Brian Williams and Chris Murphy today. He urgently needs our support in the home stretch, and it would mean a lot to Chris and Brian to know you have their backs.

Then, if youre able, I hope youll make a contribution to my re-election campaign to help me keep up my fight for Maine people in the Senate. [ Long story short: Think of a yardstick. Let me explain. My very first job out of law school brought me to Skowhegan, a small town of less than 8,000 residents back then. I worked for Pine Tree Legal Assistance, helping provide free legal aid for low-income people. Not long into my time there, I realized just how many challenges the families I helped faced. It seemed like people would come into my office with three feet of problems, but the legal aid I provided could solve only about five inches of the issues my clients struggled with. On top of that, these families were worried about everything from education to health care to transportation all challenges that come with living in poverty. I wanted a way I could help people solve issues that were on the whole yardstick, not just the few inches I could deal with as a lawyer. Then, when Maine voters elected me to my first term as governor in 1994, I finally got my chance. I dedicated all my effort to creating jobs, reigniting Maines economy, reforming our state mental health services, pursuing common-sense environmental protections, and more. Now in my role as senator, I can do even more to help people in Maine and across the country tackle the issues further up their yardstick. Ive committed myself to working to improve the prospects for all Maine people, protect our national security interests, build a stronger democracy, and safeguard our environment for future generations. Its the most important job of my career, and Id be honored to continue my work building bipartisan consensus for the challenges facing our nation but I cant do it without you, friend. So if youre able, can you chip in a donation of $10 or any amount to support my re-election campaign? Im here on behalf of people like you, and I promise to continue to work hard for you in the days and weeks ahead. [ If you've saved your payment information with FastAction, your donation will go through immediately: CHIP IN $10 NOW [ CHIP IN $25 NOW [ CHIP IN $50 NOW [ CHIP IN $100 NOW [ CHIP IN $250 NOW [ ANOTHER AMOUNT [ I am incredibly grateful for all your support know that I will continue to work to build a better Maine, every inch of the way up that yardstick.

        "content_plain": "Katie Porter for Senate Young lady, Wells Fargo does not make mistakes. Those were the words I heard in late 2007 after presenting my research showing 70% of lenders were trying to collect more money than homeowners believed they owed. Back up for a second: In 2007 I was a law professor researching whether banks were taking advantage of homeowners by claiming Americans owed more than they really did. In a sample of 1,700 cases, I found banks were asking people to pay $6 million more than they expected. Banks repeatedly didnt have the documentation to back up their claims, and nobody in the system was willing or able to stop them. For so many families that meant losing their home entirely. It was a Wells Fargo lawyer who stood up after I presented my findings at a conference and lectured me on how the vast teams at Wells Fargo could afford to follow the law, and plenty of other Big Bank lawyers chimed in. The conventional wisdom was that banks were always right, and nobody needed to question it. If banks dont make mistakes, the next logical conclusion was that this was in fact a deliberate strategy to break the rules and cheat borrowers. Because of this research, a few months later I was asked to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Senator Chuck Schumer came prepared with a poster board, and pointed out how Wall Street boasted their strategy of foreclosure and late fees helped them become even more profitable. I left that hearing thinking punishment was coming for those lawbreaking banks, but for the most part they continued to collect every penny without following every rule. As a professor, I could study and point out problems. But I wanted to do more to actually change our system. Im running for the U.S. Senate to fight for the people who have been taken advantage of by big corporations and are struggling to get ahead. Thats the work Ive always done, and with your support I can head back to the Senatethis time with the power to hold Wall Street to account.I'd be so appreciative of anything you can chip in before 1/31 to help us meet our January fundraising goal and power our campaign.

Danforth even cleared the crowded field of Republican challengers in Hawleys primary. THEN On January 6, 2021, Josh Hawley showed the world that hes a coward and a fraud by raising his fist then running for his life at the U.S. Capitol. NOW Danforth and a handful of Hawleys other mentors + mega-donors are refusing to support his re-election campaign and recent reports from Morning Consult found Hawleys approvals plummeting among Missouri voters. Republicans and Democrats across Missouri agree: We cant afford another six years of Josh Hawley representing us in the U.S. Senate. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN Now heres why we need your help, Jenga: Every dollar we raise gives us an opportunity to keep exposing Hawley as a fraud and a coward and allows us to reach voters with Lucas election-winning message every day between now and November 5.

Jonathan wrote bills for Congressman Ron Paul, including the predecessor to the Right to Try Act signed into law by President Trump. That predecessor bill, the Access to Medical Treatment Act, was introduced again and again by Ron Paul and was blocked every session of Congress by the drug lobby. Then Rand Paul introduced an updated version of the bill Jonathan originally wrote, and this time, with the backing of President Trump, the bill became law. The Right to Try Act saved countless lives by removing FDA from blocking terminally ill patients from having access to experimental treatments. That is but one of Jonathans many accomplishments that have saved American lives and liberty. A renowned constitutional litigator and scholar, Jonathan holds the record or defeating FDA censorship in court, eight times, earning him the name FDA Dragon Slayer. He is one of the few attorneys in American history to defeat the federal bureaucracy repeatedly, gaining him great respect from his colleagues and an AV rating (highest in legal ability and ethics) from the Martindale Hubbell law rating organization. Jonathans victories have saved countless lives, including those of the unborn. Jonathan seems destined for his role to restore our republic and uphold the Constitution against those who would replace it with a communist dictatorship. With a boxing legend and career military father and an off-the-charts smart mother, Jonathan had wonderfully patriotic and intelligent role models early in life that inspired him to fight for liberty, against communism and tyranny, and in defense of the American republic his entire career. A masterful debater who has outperformed the best attorneys the Department of Justice has to offer, Jonathan will defeat Kaine. But even Jonathan can't win this fight alone. The June primaries are our battleground to oust career politicians like Tim Kaine. Your support is the ammunition we need. Currently, we are $40,000 short of the funds required. The January 31 deadline is fast approaching. Each dollar raised now will greatly affect the outcome of this race.

If youve got a minute, please let us explain why: FIRST: Another Arizona poll was released last week showing Ruben trailing Kari Lake by a couple points. We have to turn these polls around. FAST. THEN: Kari Lake held a fundraiser with two wealthy QAnon activists on Friday a dangerous and violent anti-government conspiracy theory at the heart of the MAGA-right. NOW: Were expecting Kyrsten Sinema to decide whether or not to run for re-election any day and we need to ramp up our fundraising to be ready for whatever she decides. Arizona is the seat Democrats need to win to hold the Senate. And the fate of the Senate depends on how strong our fundraising is. If everyone reading this chipped in $5 or $10 Ruben would have everything he needs to win this race. But not everyone chips in. Thats why we need you. We need people who know how important this Senate race is, people who understand how important their donations are to our campaign to chip in what they can, when they can. Can we count on you? Use this link and contribute $5, $10, whatever you can to help Ruben win in Arizona and defend our Senate majority. With hundreds of people chipping in alongside you, its going to add up fast.

Its an honor to fight for Rhode Islanders every single day, and weve seen what a Democratic majority in the Senate can do. We passed the American Rescue Plan and our job-creating bipartisan infrastructure bill to support working families and small businesses. We passed a law guaranteeing every American the freedom to marry the one they love. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, lowering costs for families and investing in a clean energy future. And my bill to restore the integrity of the Supreme Court passed out of committee and has momentum. There is a lot more to do. We have a razor-thin majority in the Senate and were on defense in a lot of states. But if Democrats can hold on, we can continue to take on big polluters and pass meaningful legislation to combat climate change. We can make high-quality health care more affordable and accessible. We can clean up our politics and get anonymous, unlimited special interest money out of Congress and away from the Supreme Court. If we lose our Senate majority, however, Republicans will allow every move Congress makes to be decided by the ultra-wealthy and the big corporate special interests that funded their campaigns.

Bernie Sanders It is no great secret that millions of Americans feel that Congress is more interested in protecting large corporations than looking out for ordinary people. That is never clearer than when we talk about our broken health care system, and the outrageous price of prescription drugs in this country. The truth is, if you ask most Americans Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, conservatives they will agree: we are getting ripped off, big time, by the pharmaceutical industry. As a nation, we spend almost twice as much per capita as any other country on health care over $13,000 for every man, woman and child. Even for those with insurance, costs are so high that medical bills are often the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States. And one of the major reasons for the high cost of health care in America is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. You tell me: why does Merck charge diabetes patients in the United States $6,900 for Januvia when the exact same product can be purchased in Canada for $900 and just $200 in France? Why does Johnson & Johnson charge Americans with arthritis $79,000 for Stelara when it can be purchased for just $16,000 in the United Kingdom? And why does Bristol Myers Squibb charge patients in our country $7,100 for Eliquis when the same product can be purchased for just $900 in Canada and just $650 in France? On and on it goes. Almost every prescription drug costs far more in the United States than it does in other countries. The good news is that we are beginning to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare, for the first time ever, is negotiating the price of some drugs, including Januvia, Stelara and Eliquis. The bad news is that the pharmaceutical industry is doing everything it can to stop these negotiations, and prevent Congress from making prescription drugs affordable for all Americans not just those on Medicare. The giant pharmaceutical and health insurance lobbies have spent huge amounts of money over the past decades to ensure that their profits come before the health of the American people. Over the past 25 years, the drug companies have spent $8.5 billion on lobbying. Today, they have some 1,800 well-paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C. including former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties. Unbelievably, that is more than three lobbyists for every member of Congress. During that same period, they have provided over $700 million in campaign contributions. And they are equal opportunity contributors. They contribute heavily to both Republican and Democratic candidates. The result of congressional inaction is that these large corporations have driven up the prices of prescription drugs to the point that one out of four Americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe. Meanwhile, while millions of Americans suffer and some die because they cant afford the prescription drugs they need, 10 of the top pharmaceutical companies in the country made over $110 billion in profits in 2022 and paid their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages. As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), one of my top priorities is to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America. One of the ways to do that is to hold the chief executives of some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in our country accountable for their actions. That is why I have invited Robert Davis, the CEO of Merck; Joaquin Duato, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson; and Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb, to a hearing to discuss what they are doing to lower drug prices in America. Why did we ask these CEOs to come before us? Because the American people deserve answers to some pretty simple questions. For example: Why is it that the median price of new prescription drugs in America is now over $220,000 including many new cancer drugs? How does it happen that while millions of Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, when major drug companies in America spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than they do on research and development? Why is there an enormous lack of transparency in how your companies set drug prices? These very straightforward questions are on the minds of millions of Americans. These are questions that the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to answer. And lets be clear: these are not struggling companies forced to charge high prices to survive. Believe me, they are not going broke. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made nearly $18 billion in profits, paid its CEO over $27 million in compensation and spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and dividends. That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit, handed out over $7 billion in dividends to their wealthy stockholders and paid its CEO over $52 million in compensation. And Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits last year, while recently spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and giving its CEO over $41 million in compensation. I am proud of what the committee has already accomplished. Last year, the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP Committee hearing that his company would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out of pocket. In a separate HELP Committee hearing last May, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products. The committees efforts are paying off, but much more needs to be done. I look forward to the hearing on Feb. 8, with the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers Squibb, to discuss how they will substantially lower the price of prescription drugs in America. - Before you go.

My opponents are spending MILLIONS on flooding the airwaves, and any ads I could afford to launch would be drowned out immediately. But this race won't be won on TV. It'll be won on the ground and I just happen to have one of the most impressive grassroots operations in the state. That's why, in these final days, I'm heavily investing in meeting voters where they are. That means more lawn signs, more rallies, more door knockers and more phone bankers. Friend, I need your help expanding my voter outreach efforts even further. Your $5 end-of-month donation will help us reach those last voters with my progressive platform and record in these critical last days. So I'm humbly asking: Will you donate $5 or more before January ends?

I grew up in a working-class family; my mom was a public school teacher and my dad was a salesman for Trans World Airlines. When I was 11, my dad moved the family to start a working farm. My brothers and I carried much of the load, collecting eggs, cleaning hog pens and chicken houses, and all the other work a farm requires. It was tough, but the farm taught us the value of hard work, determination, and persistence. When our family fell on hard times, my father filed for bankruptcy and we lost the farm. From that point on, I learned there's no shame in asking for help but there is in not helping. Thats why Im running for Senate to bring Marylanders together to solve big problems like the opioid crisis, criminal justice reform, and mental health. But no one runs for office alone so Ill need folks like you involved every step of the way.

        "content_plain": "Well, team, as Im sure youve seen by now, Trump won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. Hes a step closer to grabbing the Republican nomination for president. Trumps wins come on the heels of his latest comments on the Supreme Court: For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it And Im proud to have done it. Trump did indeed confirm three of the extremist justices who overturned Roe. As a result, millions of American women had their freedom taken away, and here Trump is, bragging about it. And even worse? If he wins again in November AND the GOP take back the Senate? Theyll have a nationwide abortion ban ready to go. We have to take this threat seriously. Thats why Im personally asking if you can donate to my campaign ahead of our end-of-month fundraising deadline to send me back to the Senate and support my work to expand our Democratic Senate majority and send Joe Biden back to the White House.

Then, my potential opponent a self-funding GOP millionaire went on the offensive, flooding the airwaves with an attack ad against me. Now, I'm falling short of my $250,000 end-of-monthgoal and if support doesn't pick up in the next couple of hours, I'm afraid we won't have the proper resources to fight back. Experts at FiveThirtyEight say this race could decide Senate control. I know it might seem early, butfailing to respond to the GOP's attacks right nowcould have a serious impact on our ability to keep Ohio and the Senate blue.

Before I tell you all about why I decided to run, I want to make you a simple promise: I will always take the time to learn from and listen to you. Ill work diligently every single day to make this community proud. The truth is, there arent that many people in the Senate who live and think like the people they were elected to represent. I know the people of Maryland should have a Senator who not only fights for them, but who also understands and shares their concerns. The journey were beginning today is an investment in a better tomorrow, for Maryland and for our country. I cant tell you how grateful I am that youre by my side, Jenga. Early support will put us on the best possible footing for the road ahead. If you can, will you invest $15, $25, or any amount in our campaign for the U.S. Senate? Chip in $25 Chip in $50 Chip in $100 Chip in $200 Chip in $250 Other Amount Each time Ive run for office, its because I recognized a problem that I had the right tools to fix. Thats the outlook handed down to me by my great-grandmother, Maebell James. She was the strongest woman Ive ever met. She prevailed over cruelty and injustice in her life with inexhaustible dignity. She had one rule for her family: No complaints. Shed often say, If you don't like something, you go farther and you do better. That lesson lived on through my hard-working parents. They taught me what integrity looks like and to respect all work. Their example led me to run for office for the first time 13 years ago, right here in Prince Georges County. I fought to develop new economic opportunities, improve the health, safety, and security of our communities, and strengthen our education system. Im deeply proud of the things weve accomplished so far but in Washington, theres plenty of work left to do. With a little determination and a good attitude, I know we can go farther and do better for all Marylanders. There will be bumps on the journey ahead. But as I write this, theres not a doubt in my mind that well overcome them together. Jenga, if you can, will you chip in $25 to our historic campaign? I cant tell you just how much I value your support.

Sherrod Brown Friend I know you're probably busy, so I'll get right to it: I'm in a dead heat with my opponents in Ohio's Senate race, and I can only surge ahead if I reach my $50,000 fundraising goal before our midnight deadline. So please, is there anything I can say to convince you to split $5 between my campaign and Jacky Rosens to defend our Democratic majority in the Senate? Would it make a difference if I told you that Mitch McConnell is coming after me as a top target to flip the Senate red? What if I told you that my three GOP opponents are millionaires who can self-fund their campaigns and one of them just spent $2 million to flood the airwaves with TV ads in Ohio? And, what if I told you that with polls showing me neck and neck with my opponents, we're still falling short of our midnight goal with just hours until the deadline? So, what do you say, friend? If you're ready to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority, please split $5 between my campaign and Jackys now. Thanks for the help. Let's keep this seat blue in November!

The reason we published this article is because Dave and I truly believe that America is the greatest country to have ever existed. We want people here who love America, not people who hate our great country. We both have been able to live our own American Dream stories because of the opportunities and freedoms that this country offers. What has set this country apart is the American Dream. The idea that if you worked hard you could provide a good life for yourself and your family. This country affords the greatest opportunities to live, work, and raise a family. But with the increase in these pro-terrorist protests, sky-high inflation, an increase in crime, and open borders, I know that the Democrats&rsquo; failing policies are making the American Dream more distant. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to reach out to you, freedom-loving Americans who want to live your own American Dream. Do you think the American Dream is slipping away? Please take a minute out of your day to let me know what you think about the American Dream. Your input is critical to me, Dave, and other leaders in Washington as we try to represent you. Thank you, Senator Marco Rubio More About Dave McCormick My name is Dave McCormick and I&rsquo;m running for the U.S. Senate. I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg. On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that. Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, as it stands today, those dreams are at risk. We are at a breaking point and the direction we choose to go will chart the course for the future of Pennsylvania and our country. Time and again, America has proved resilient in the face of adversity. I have a plan and the experience to move our commonwealth forward. I am a battle-tested leader who is ready to fight for YOU. With Democrats holding the Senate Majority by just one seat, the significance of this Senate race will shape our future, for better or for worse. Will you join me today and help save our great commonwealth? DONATE TODAY Thank you, Dave McCormick GRAB YOUR OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN MERCH Dave&rsquo;s campaign relies on grassroots supporters like you!

        "content_plain": "Friend, I found some photos from when I was younger that I would like to share with you. Images of Representative Lee: as an infant, as a school cheerleader, and as a young woman I was born in El Paso, Texas, via an emergency forceps delivery. My mother's pregnancy wasn't particularly dangerous but because she was initially denied admission to the hospital while in active labor due to the color of her skin, we both nearly died. Throughout my childhood, my family and I continued to be treated as lesser. My father was a lieutenant colonel and my mother served as the first Black clerical worker in Fort Bliss and still, despite all the service they provided for our nation, we were judged by the color of our skin. But, while my parents couldn't control how the world treated me, theycouldcontrol how I was taught to treat the world. So they taught me to keep my chin high and never settle for less than I deserved. When I was just 15 after we moved from the deeply segregated South to California I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But I didn't look like the kind of person the selection committee would choose for the all-white girls cheer team. So I partnered with the NAACP and became my school'sfirstBlack girl cheerleader. I then went on to become the president of Mills College's Black Student Union, where I had the honor of meeting our nation's first Black congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm. She took one look at me a young single mother who was so passionate about getting an education that I even took my boys with me to class when I couldn't afford child care and knew that I would one day create the change that women like me needed. I heeded Rep. Chisholm's words and registered to vote, thus beginning a long journey that ended in Washington, D.C. And when I saw the opportunity to represent California's 12th Congressional District, I put my head down and worked hard winning the special election and following in Shirley Chisholm's footsteps. Now, I'm the only Black woman in the California Senate primary and I'm ready to take the experience, struggles and voice of Black women to the Senate. Friend, with just 32 days to go until the election, the latest polls show this race is wide open.So please, to help me leave my mark, build a progressive future that works for all and become our nation's fourth Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate: Can I count on you to chip in $5 or more now so that Black women can have a voice in the Senate for years to come?

She raised me on her own in Dallas, and I spent most afternoons at the local YMCA while she worked a second job to make ends meet. With a lot of hard work and support from my mom, coaches, and teachers, I earned a full football scholarship to Baylor and went on to play in the NFL. Then, I went to law school, became a civil rights attorney to protect voting rights, and served in the Obama administration. I ran for Congress because I dont want my story to be the exception I want all kids to have every opportunity to achieve their dreams. Now, Im running for Senate because Im sick and tired of watching Ted Cruz fail Texas kids and families. And experts agree we can win since launching our campaign, CNN has named Ted Cruz the most vulnerable Republicanin the Senate. Its going to take the biggest grassroots movement Texas has ever seen, and I need you to be a part of it, friend. So please: Will you chip in any amount today to help me send Ted Cruz packing once and for all?

Please, read an important message from Colin below and chip in $5 or $10 to help him win in Texas: Friend, nothing prepared me for the hollow feeling I woke up with on Nov. 9, 2016 the day after Donald Trump was elected. At the time, I was working in President Obama's administration, and I couldn't believe our country had made so much progress, only to elect someone who wanted to take us backward. I couldn't help but question if I could have done more if we all could have done more to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. I didn't know it that day, but Trump's election and the dangerous direction he and his far-right supporters took our country in would be one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress. I couldn't stand what was happening, and I had to do whatever I could to change it. Turns out, a lot of people felt the same way I did and that's how we defeated a 22-year GOP incumbent and elected me as TX-32s first ever Democratic Congressman and won back the House for Democrats in 2018. My motivation remains the same in this race. For the last decade, I've watched Ted Cruz fail Texans time and again. I know I can do better, and I know Texans are ready for change. But this race is going to come down to a handful of votes, and Ted Cruz has special interests and mega donors lining his pockets to crush our grassroots movement. He's got over $7.3 MILLION in the bank, and I've got to hit my critical deadlines just to keep up. I know I don't want to wake up the day after Election Day on Nov. 6th wishing we had done more to defeat Ted Cruz, friend. That's why I have to ask: Will you donate $5, $10, or any amount you can spare to support my campaign? Every dollar brings us that much closer to firing Ted Cruz and bringing real leadership to Texas. No regrets, Colin Allred - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

I can be the additional vote we need to finally abolish the filibuster, address economic injustice and pass crucial legislation like restoring abortion access nationwide. But I'm up against opponents who are sitting on MILLIONS, and if I don't get more resources ASAP, they may drown me out. Polling shows that as many as 20% of California voters are still undecided just over a month out from election day, so this is truly still anyone's race. That's why I'm focusing all of my efforts on expanding my voter outreach efforts on the ground. But if I miss this fundraising goal my FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out I'll have to make tough decisions, like pulling back our efforts to reach California voters. Friend, this close to election day, every choice we each make is incredibly impactful. It could be your $5 donation that helps us knock on just enough doors, call just enough voters or run just enough ads to push this campaign and our movement across the finish line.

And now that GOP legislatures have gerrymandered away the Democratic House majority, its clear that the fight for the future of our democracy will happen within the Senate. We must press on to continue the hard work of repairing the damage Trump and MAGA Republicans have done to our nation and its institutions while defending against their continued attempts to propagate the Big Lie and undermine the right to vote. We must do so in the context of another Trump presidential campaign already in full swing. There are so many important priorities right now, and I want to know where you think I should focus my efforts as we build this Senate campaign. Will you take a moment (just a moment) to tell me what you think I should prioritize on this campaign? After all, Jenga, you have taken up the struggle for the heart and soul of our democracy, and you should help set our agenda. TAKE THE SURVEY Thanks for all you have already done to help us make this historic progress and I look forward to fighting alongside you in the important work still to come. Thanks so much.

Im committed to restoring abortion access and protecting reproductive freedom in all 50 states by ending the filibuster and codifying Roe v.

Holding politicians + corporate elites accountable: Too many of our leaders have been bought off by the massive corporations responsible for stripping our communities for parts.

Showing up for working Missourians: Real workers are tired of corporate elites and frauds writing the rules we all have to live by. Ill always stand on the side of working people by continuing to fight for the right to organize and pushing back against anti-union Right-to-Work scams in Missouri + all across the country. A Marshall Plan for the Midwest: DC politicians spent decades wasting trillions of dollars on corporate handouts and forever wars.

YOU have grassroots power, and together, we ARE grassroots power. Will you join me in supporting Senator Brown with a donation of $5, or whatever you can afford? Heres why Sherrod is worthy of your support. When I was growing up, my mom taught speech in public school, and my dad was a firefighter. They taught me the value of hard work, and most importantly, the dignity of work. Today, Im still a proud member of three unions. Im inspired by Sherrods campaign because he's a proven champion for workers' rights. Hes spent his life in the trenches advocating for everything from higher wages to the right to unionize. And Sherrod has always been a fearless leader at the forefront of protecting civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights, and reproductive rights. Sherrod will always stand up for working families like the one in which I grew up. Thats why Im asking you to use your grassroots power to make sure that a significant majority of Buckeye Staters turn out and vote to keep him in the U.S. Senate. Will you donate right now to keep our dignity of work champion Sherrod Brown in the U.S. Senate? Sherrod has run on these issues and won elections in the past, but Ohio has become increasingly challenging for a Democrat to win statewide. Sherrod is one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Ohios race for his seat could decide Senate control. Jenga, with Republicans getting millions of dollars from billionaires who pay less in taxes than American workers do, grassroots power is the most effective way to keep Sherrod Brown as our champion in the Senate and ensure that our hopes, our dreams, and our rights are the law of the land. So please, will you join me RIGHT NOW in chipping in $5, or whatever you can afford, to reelect Sherrod in Ohio so he can continue fighting for working families across the country? Thank you so much for being engaged in this fight. Your support really matters. We can do this! Wishing you and your family all the best, Carole King Carole King is a singer-songwriter, author, and activist.

Unfortunately, we got some disappointing news this morning that I need to share: 1.Adam Schiff is running TV ads to *boost* our Republican opponent, Steve Garvey. Running an ad that highlights another candidate in a way that boosts their credibility with a certain sect of voters is a way politicians try to game the system to get an opponent they have the best chance of defeating. Adam Schiff is doing this because he knows he will lose to us in November if we beat Steve Garvey and advance to the general election. That's what this brazenly cynical ad is aboutfurthering Adams own political career, boxing out qualified Democratic women candidates, and boosting a Republican candidate to do it. We need honest leadership, not political games. 2.A new USC poll released today, conducted right after last weeks debate, showed us completely tied with Steve Garvey for second place. Even after Steve Garveys refusal to take a single solid policy position in the debate, were still in a dead heat. To make it to the general election, we just need to place second in the primary, but todays news shows were at real risk of coming in third. Is there anything you can give right now to help us ramp up our ads and reach the voters who will decide this race? Donate This is going to be an incredibly close race, and every dollar counts.

If you would like to help send me a true battle-tested progressive to the Senate, click here to rush a donation to my campaign. Listen, I didn't become the most liberal member of the House overnight. This title required years of supporting progressive causes and never once wavering from them even in the face of death threats. I was the only person in Congress to vote against the 60-word resolution that gave President George W. Bush nearly unlimited war powers in the days following 9/11. I've been an unwavering leader in the fight to make the rich pay their fair share and have introduced legislation with Sen. Bernie Sanders to tax Wall Street. I've played a key role in passing the expanded Child Tax Credit which reduced child poverty by 46%. I've spent years fighting for Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, debt-free college, the expansion of critical safety net programs and ending the racist war on drugs and have served on several committees to work toward these goals. Friend, I'm honored to be ranked the most liberal member of the House but now, I've set my sights on taking my progressive agenda to the Senate. If you help me get to the Senate, you can rest assured that I will always be at the forefrontof the fight for progress just as I have been for decades in the House. So I have to ask, as this is shaping up to be the most competitive Senate races in history: Will you donate any amount you can spare to my campaign and help me build a progressive future for all?

It isnt standard practice for lawmakers to take private jets using government funds. Each Member of Congress is allotted an office budget, which we normally use to pay for staff who serve constituents, events like town halls, and commercial flights to get ourselves from our homestates to DC. This type of taxpayer dollar abuse is unacceptable. Ive introduced legislation to boost accountability and inform the public about when, where, and how Members of Congress travel on the taxpayers dime. Can you sign my petition to show your support for this bill? Sign on: Transparency in Taxpayer-Funded Travel Act Stories like this fuel Americans' distrust in our government, and people are right to be concerned. Too many politicians allocate money to pet projects, take marching orders from corporations, and slip loopholes into bills on behalf of their biggest donors. I was shocked by the amount of legalized corruption I saw when I first got to Congress in 2019, and since then, Ive made cleaning this place up one of my top priorities. Now, Im the only person in this race who supports banning corporate PAC and federal lobbyist money, and doing away with earmarkswhich lead to waste and fraud.

When I was 14, my family came to America to seek a better life. We arrived here with big dreams for the future. But those early days were hard. I remember my mom working back-to-back double shifts and still struggling to afford rent for our small, one room apartment. So, after I turned 15, I got a job working the early morning shift at a local doughnut shop. It was just a minimum wage job, but the small checks I brought home gave my family room to breathe. Finally, after a lot of hard work, the possibilities that we could only dream of before became reality. We were able to move out of that one room apartment, and I got a scholarship to an incredible college. Eventually, I found a career path where I could give back to the communities and country that gave me so much. That call to service took me to places I had never even dreamed of before. I became the first South American immigrant to serve in Congress, and now, I'm running for the United States Senate. Making doughnuts in the morning before homeroom brought me all the way to Congress. I've seen time and time again how small acts have the power to create big, transformative change. And that's exactly how we're going to win this campaign this November. That's why I'm asking you to chip in just $10 about the cost of a dozen doughnuts to send me to the Senate. Can you split a donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrandbefore my weekly deadline to help me defeat Rick Scott?

Black Americans have long facedfar too many obstacles like: discrimination, lower pay, higher job instability not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents. I'm ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfect union for my boys and every kid in Texas. But unlike Ted Cruz, I don't have corporate special interests footing the bill for my campaign. To win, I need a massive movement of grassroots supporters to step up and join me in this fight.

Wisconsinites have made it clear how they feel about restoring and protecting reproductive rights we proved it by electing Justice Janet Protasiewicz to the state Supreme Court last year and with your help, we can prove it again this year. My likely Republican opponent, Eric Hovde, is an anti-abortion extremist who wants to drag our country backwards by passing a national abortion ban. We simply cant let that happen. Jenga, Im hoping youll support my fight to protect and expand our rights and freedoms by making a donation to my reelection campaign. Will you pitch in any amount youre able to today to help me defeat anti-abortion Republicans? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: CHIP IN $5 NOW CHIP IN $10 NOW CHIP IN $25 NOW CHIP IN $50 NOW CHIP IN $100 NOW ANOTHER AMOUNT Thanks for sticking with me in this fight.

I spend a lot of time thinking about the world our kids are living in now, and what kind of world were providing for them in the future. My greatest mission is to create a world for my kids thats better than the one I grew up in. If youre a parent, Im sure you feel the same way. And frankly, I refuse to sit by and do nothing knowing that Senator Kevin Cramer tried to cut the affordable healthcare that so many families rely on. I refuse to sit by and do nothing while hardworking parents are struggling to find affordable housing or childcare for their kids. I refuse to sit by and do nothing while the women of North Dakota worry that one of their most fundamental rights how and when to have a family will be stripped from them entirely. Thats exactly why Im running for U.S. Senate to make sure all of our kids grow up in a country we can be proud of. Right now, I have one of the best chances in the entire country to flip a Senate seat from red to blue. Im running to create a better country for my family, and yours. But I need your help to get there. I set an ambitious goal to raise 789 gifts before my End of Week Deadline in 12 hours.

        "content_plain": "A year ago, Chris sent the email below to announce that he was running for re-election and explain why he was staying in this fight. We wanted to re-share this with you today. Since he sent this, the response has been humbling. Tens of thousands of people (including you!) have chipped in since then to build a true grassroots campaign. Over 95% of our donations come from folks giving $100 or less and not a dime from PACs or corporations. Thank you so much for being a donor. Your support means the world to Chris and is the reason we are in a strong position today. There are still a lot of tough fights ahead of us, but if we stay in this together, then we will prevail. If you are able to help us sustain our momentum, please consider contributing to our campaign today to fuel our people-powered movement. - I wanted you to hear this directly from me: I am officially running for re-election. I love this work being your voice and representing Connecticut in the U.S. Senate means the world to me. So much has happened in these two years. Most importantly for me, we defied the odds and passed the first major gun safety bill in 30 years. As the author and champion of the bill, I know that the gun lobby is coming after me. And after we passed climate legislation and drug pricing legislation, I know the oil companies and drug industry are coming too. So I am counting on a lot of grassroots support as we kick off this race. Will you please make a contribution to my re-election today to make sure were ready for whatever comes our way? Grassroots donations are the heart of our campaign. It is what allows me to focus on and deliver meaningful progressive change in the U.S. Senate. CONTRIBUTE: When I came to the Senate, there was a feeling of defeat amongst progressives. For decades, we had tried unsuccessfully to pass transformative legislation to lower carbon emissions. We had struck out, again and again, trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs. And we had been stymied, for three long decades, by the gun lobby. I ran for the Senate to be part of the group that would upend this status quo. And we did. We passed the biggest gun safety bill in nearly three decades, lowered prescription drug costs, made major investments in Americas infrastructure, and delivered the most aggressive climate action bill ever. Slowly but surely, we are shifting the power back from billionaires and corporations to the American people. But the status quo fights back. And I know that the billionaires and the gun companies are going to throw the kitchen sink at me this campaign. So I cannot do this alone. The truth is Senate campaigns require significant resources, so I am asking for your support to help me start this re-election campaign strong: Please contribute any amount you can afford to my re-election today. Its important that we send a powerful message about the strength of our movement, and the donation itself is just as important as the amount. CONTRIBUTE: When we win, I plan to build on the success of the past two years. We need to pass voting rights legislation, restore the right to an abortion, and build on our 2022 gun safety bill by passing universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Thank you in advance for having my back. It means the world to me that so many people like you step up to answer the call when we need it. Theres a lot of work ahead of us, but together, I know that we will be ready for anything. Every best wish, Chris Murphy CONTRIBUTE: You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:"

She organized women into a political force in Albany well before most women had any political power. My mother was one of just three women in her law school class and a black belt in karate. I remember her baking cookies with my friends and me, all the while emptying the dishwasher and talking on the phone to file the details of an adoption case she was working on. When I first ran for Congress back in 2006, my mom was one of the only people who thought I could win. I was told that my purple, upstate New York district had more cows than Democrats. But I believed then as I do now that the toughest fights arealwaysworth taking on. We won that race, and its been the honor of my life to serve New York ever since. Ive always said: Government only works when people raise their voices and demand change. Its a pretty simple premise, really. But with Washington so overrun by corporate lobbyists and special interests who trade money for access, it doesnt happen enough. But together, I believe that we can effect real, meaningful change in Washington.I believe we can protect and restore reproductive rights nationwide. I believe we can ensure thateveryAmerican has quality, affordable health care. I believe we can fight global climate change, make paid family and medical leave a reality for all Americans, enact meaningful gun safety laws and build a more just and equitable economy. With so much at stake,Jenga,I needyourhelp.Democrats are hanging on to our Senate majority by a thread. Mitch McConnell only needs to flip two seats to retake control. And becauseI refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, I cant fight back against the GOPs megadonor machine, keep this seat blue and defend our narrow majority without your grassroots support. So please, will you donate $5 or more right now to help me defeat the GOP in New York, defend the Senate for Democrats and continue fearlessly fighting for you in Washington?

Every candidate running for federal office was required to submit the full report of their campaigns fourth-quarter fundraising numbers to the Federal Election Commission. And once Josh Hawley filed his report, we learned that Lucas didnt just outraise him last quarter our grassroots campaign outraised Hawley for all of 2023! [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]BREAKING NEWS: Kunce outraises Hawley for Q4 and all of 2023, breaking records. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]KEEP UP OUR MOMENTUM Last year, Lucas raised $5.4 million to defeat Josh Hawley with an average donation of $33 and grassroots donors from every single county across the state, setting the record for the most ever raised in an off-year by a Senate challenger in Missouri. This is a historic accomplishment for a grassroots campaign in our state, and it wouldnt have been possible without support from real people like you. But unfortunately, its not all good news today, Jenga: Yesterdays reports also revealed that national insiders are still determined to bail out Josh Hawley. They transferred nearly $500,000 directly into his campaign and raised more into the Super PAC they funded with $1M+ last summer. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]FIGHT BACK NOW At this point, its not surprising. The insiders and elites backing Hawley have known Lucas was a threat since the day he got into this race. Theyve acted on it too, with desperate attacks and big investments into Hawleys campaign quarter after quarter. But things got worse for Hawley at the end of last year. Morning Consult confirmed that hes the least popular Republican Senator up for re-election in 2024. Then, multiple polls showed Lucas already in a margin-of-error race with Hawley making this our best opportunity to flip a GOP-held U.S. Senate seat in this election cycle. With all that new information and likely lots more to come, we know those insiders are bound to ramp up their spending and attacks against Lucas from here. Theyll do anything it takes to make Hawley look strong in this race and theyre hoping their early investments will give him the edge he needs to win. Thats why were urgently asking for your help today, Jenga. Our grassroots campaign to elect Lucas Kunce is entirely powered by real people like you not shady mega-donors or corporate elites. So when you donate to our campaign, youre giving us the ability to fight back against the GOPs desperate attacks, reach voters in every corner of the state with Lucas unifying message, and win this race in November. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1004 ]So please, will you rush a donation of $10 or whatever you can afford to our grassroots movement to elect Lucas Kunce right now?

But Adam also knows that polling shows Katie has a strong chance of becoming Californias next U.S. Senator so long as we make it out of the primary. Right now, Katie and our Republican opponent are in a dead heat in the race to qualify for the general election. Ads like the one Schiff released, which attempt to game the system, are why Americans distrust politicians.

Thankfully, it never came to that. *And while I was barricaded on the House floor with my colleagues and our gas masks in hand, Ted Cruz who had cheered on the mob earlier that day hid in a supply closet.* Ted Cruzs false claims about the 2020 election helped incite the insurrection. *That's Ted for you: All hat, no cattle.* *That day is one of many, many reasons I know Ted Cruz has got to go.* People lost their lives, and our government came the closest it ever has to crumbling. His MAGA extremism is bad for Texas and our country, and its time to hold him accountable. *Im running to replace Ted Cruz and give Texans the Senator we deserve, and I hope youll help me do it, friend.* And a new poll from last week showed me just 2 points behind Ted Cruz and *statistically tied* up from 5 points down in a 2023 poll. It couldn't be clearer we can win this race in November *if* we have the resources to do it. *But our very first end-of-month deadline of the year is approaching fast, and right now, we're falling short of this critical goal. **Will you donate now to help build our grassroots movement and defeat Ted Cruz once and for all?

I grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Jeff City. Like so many Americans, my parents lived paycheck-to-paycheck so when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, we struggled to get by. But we werent alone. When my parents had to take my sister to get surgeries at a hospital over 100 miles away in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes. And when we couldnt afford groceries, they brought more casserole and lasagna by the house than we could ever hope to eat. Thats the Missouri I grew up in. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1005 ]Lucas as a child, sitting with his family on the porch of his childhood home. The support from our neighbors and friends motivated me to work hard, stay focused on school, and run on the cross-country team. After graduating from Jefferson City High School, I was able to get into Yale which I could afford in part due to a Pell grant and scholarships from people around town. I got to keep running at Yale, too. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1006 ]On the left: Lucas at his high school graduation. On the right: Lucas running during his time at Yale. After undergrad and then law school at Mizzou, I joined the Marine Corps to honor and serve the community that had done so much for me. Less than a year after I completed training, I deployed to Iraq on my first of three tours of duty in the War on Terror, before later being stationed at the Pentagon. During those 13 years of active duty I learned firsthand what service and sacrifice for your country really means: Doing the right thing when youre thousands of miles from home, believing in a mission thats bigger than yourself, and never forgetting the community you signed up to serve. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1007 ]Photos of Lucas during his service in the Marines In Iraq, I deployed to the Sunni Triangle where I led a police training team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman, running missions through Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. From our camp, the bases burn pit loomed over us. Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on our duty. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1008 ]Photos of the burn pit Lucas lived next to in Iraq. When I got back from living next to that burn pit, I had developed a persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic. They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, its still there. Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And thats about the best story youll hear about a vet whos been exposed to burn pits. Many struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer. So imagine how we all felt when politicians who had never worn the uniform, like Josh Hawley, threw us a giant middle finger and voted against aid for exposed veterans. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1009 ]Screengrab from an op-ed Lucas put in Fox News. My final tour was on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. There, I worked with the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, and other agencies to stop the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technology around the globe, to keep these weapons out of the hands of bad actors. I spent every day doing what I could to make the world a safer place, with fewer arms, less chance of conflict, and more money to spend on improving lives rather than destroying them. One of the hardest things for me between these tours was coming back home to Jeff City, to the community I had signed up to serve, and seeing what was going on in my old neighborhood. When I came back from Iraq, the first house Id ever lived in was bulldozed down. Now, its an empty lot: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1010 ]The empty lot where Lucas' childhood home once stood. When I came back from Afghanistan, the house I lived in when I joined the Marine Corps was vacant and starting to fall apart. The corner store was boarded up. The whole time all of us were risking our lives overseas, our leaders were spending trillions of dollars trying to build up towns in these other countries places like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat when we should have been spending our money, blood, and sweat on towns like St. Joe, St. Louis, and Jefferson City. From the Middle East to the Pentagon, my time in the Marine Corps provided me with direct insight into the control that giant corporations have over our tax dollars, our politics, and our everyday lives. So after active duty, I joined the American Economic Liberties Project the nations leading non-profit in the fight against monopoly power in our economy and our democracy. We took on the corrupt politicians and monopolists who dominate our lives, squeeze small businesses out of our markets, and enrich corporate elites at the expense of everyday Americans from Big Tech and agribusiness conglomerates, to pharmaceutical cartels and defense contractors. But now corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley dont just attack our way of life, but the democracy I swore to defend. Everyday people should be calling the shots in our country not giant corporations or the cowards and phonies they bought off in Washington. Thats why Im running for U.S. Senate: To take power back for working families in Missouri and across America. And make no mistake about it, Missouri is on the frontline of this fight. While our state has been getting stripped for parts, politicians like Josh Hawley have been attacking workers with schemes like Right-to-Work and fighting to block wage increases for Missouri families all to enrich multinational corporations and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns. As dozens of headquarters have been taken out of state, politicians in power like Josh Hawley were happy to sit back and watch it happen. Manufacturing, agriculture, production theyre shipping it all away to foreign oligarchs who dont care about working people in our state. And while Missouri was getting gutted, these same politicians voted time and time again to spend trillions of dollars and thousands of lives on overseas wars that got their Big Oil friends rich. Theyve spent decades sparking phony culture wars to distract and divide our families. Theyve become so obsessed with controlling our lives, they made Missouri the first state in the nation to ban abortion without exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Our state deserves a Senator who will stand up and fight for it, not run for the exit like Josh Hawley. Im running for U.S. Senate to be the warrior for working people that Missouri deserves to fight like hell for our state and our people. Weve spent months uniting Missouris election-winning labor movement behind our campaign with early endorsements from the Missouri AFL-CIO, Missouri Fire Fighters, and dozens more statewide and union locals. And multiple recent polls have shown were already in a tight race against Hawley, who Morning Consult has consistently found to be the most vulnerable GOP Senator running in 2024. But if were going to stand up to the DC insiders and corporate elites spending millions to prop up Hawley and keep their grip on this Senate seat, we need your support to continue building a record-breaking, people-powered movement. Im not taking a single cent from corporate PACs in this race so we can stand up to the status quo and take back power for real working people across the state. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1011 ]So Jenga, will you join our people-powered movement by chipping in $10 or whatever you can afford today?

And we can abolish corporate PACs and demand a government that safeguards our democracy and holds corrupt politicians accountable. We can build an economy that puts American workers and small businesses first, not giant corporations and foreign oligarchs an economy that invests in the next generation of energy. We can put an end to pointless, trillion-dollar wars and invest in a Marshall Plan for the Midwest a historic investment in our workers and communities to rebuild our forgotten towns and cities, and to finally start making stuff in America again.

For much of this race, I've been outraised by my opponents by millions of dollars but we haven't let that inhibit us. Thanks to this incredibly passionate grassroots team, we've been able to reach voters up and down the state with our vision for progress, and our momentum is catching. My campaign for Senate received the most endorsements at the California Democratic Party Convention and, with as many as 20% of voters still undecided, I truly do mean it when I say that this race is still up for grabs. So here's how we're going to do this: With people casting their votes in the primary election right now, we're going to drastically expand our grassroots efforts to get out the vote and I'm counting on you to help fund these efforts.

Republican efforts to prioritize hearings for these initiatives have been unanimously rejected by House Democrats, while bills granting extensive influence to the Attorney General over fiscal notes for alternative initiatives have received swift attention.

Were currently running TV ads in four different media marketsLos Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, Sacramento, and San Diego. Were also running a wide variety of digital ads, in both Spanish and English, all across the state. Voters are learning more about our plan to shake up the Senate on Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Snapchat and more. In a year where Americans are increasingly retreating to different corners of the internet, your resources are helping us connect with people of all ages and backgrounds. Running these ads is critical, because recent polls show this as a tight race. Im neck and neck with Republican celebrity Steve Garvey for second place. And in this race, second place matters quite a bit. The top two vote-getters in Marchs primary, regardless of party, advance to the General Election. Polling shows Im in a very strong position to win the general election, regardless of who the other candidate is. But right now were at real risk of being pushed out. That means my time in Congress would come to an end. I need your help to make sure that doesnt happen. Truthfully, to win we need to be running ads in additional media marketsmy opponent is already running TV ads in places we arent, like Palm Springs. Im the only candidate in this race who has never taken money from corporate PACs and doesnt take money from federal lobbyists, so I truly count on you. With that in mind, can you please make your first donation to our senate campaign of $5 today? Heres a link:  Im so grateful to have you on our team.

And I'm all in to protect my battleground seat in Nevada so I can keep up the fight for affordable health care, reproductive freedom, and the issues that matter most to working families.

Please, will you chip in $5 or more now to help me keep Nevada and the Senate blue? Rosen for Nevada - 2024 Election Year Founding Donor In Nevada's last Senate race, the GOP spent MILLIONS and came within less than a percentage point. Now, they know that the path to Senate control once again goes right through Nevada, so they're doing whatever it takes to finally flip this battleground red. Already, a shady MAGA billionaire dumped $2 MILLION into this race to prop up McConnell's handpicked candidate, and we know this is just the beginning. That's why we're on a mission to build the strongest grassroots team possible as early as possible to fight back and defend this seat. So please, I'm counting on your immediate grassroots support: Will you give $5 or more now to become an Election Year Founding Donor, power this reelection campaign to victory in Nevada, and defend our Democratic Senate majority?

Katie Porter with a whiteboard that reads \"80% of donations are $25 or less\" Im running because better than the way things were isnt good enough.

Its not good enough that extremist politicians could ban abortion nationwide if they win just a few more Senate seats. Our country isnt working for the majority of working people.

I know that if we want to see change, we need more regular people like me in the Senate. But the truth is: Running for office is incredibly expensive. Hitting the first End of Month Deadline of the new year could be the difference between funding a winning campaign, or struggling to keep up. So Im personally asking: Will you chip in $15 now? I dont take any Corporate PAC money, so my campaign is powered by regular folks chipping in a few bucks at a time. >> [ After my End of Month Deadline hits in 72 hours, everyone will be watching to see if my campaign is strong enough to flip this seat blue.

        "content_plain": "Hi everyone, As we step into Black History Month, I want to tell you the story of a soda fountain in the segregated South before 1964. At that time, barely fifty years ago, Black customers werent even allowed to sit in the same seats as white customers. Thanks to heroes like Dr. King and Fannie Lou Hamer, change was slowly spreading across America. But change hadnt yet come to many small southern towns. Even the seats at the soda fountain were still segregated until one worker decided he was tired of waiting for that to change. He thought that if his Black customers werent allowed to sit, then nobody should be, and he removed every single seat in that shop. Until everyone could sit as equals, theyd all just have to stand. The man who removed those seats was my Dad, and I think about what he did often. Dad believed we all have a role to play in making change for the benefit of all, and by removing those seats, he found a common-sense solution to address an injustice. **Photo of Tammy Murphy and her father after Tammy's college graduation. Tammy is in a cap and gown holding a diploma, and her dad is beaming with pride.** Fifty years later, weve come a long way from the days of segregation, but we have a long way to go still. Systemic racism lives on, and we all have a role to play in fighting back against it. Its why I made combating racial disparities in maternal and infant health the key issue of my time as First Lady, and its driving my campaign for the U.S. Senate today. This month, lets celebrate men and women like Dr. King, Fannie Lou Hamer, John Lewis, and so many more, who have helped us come so far. But lets not stop there. Lets ask ourselves what small things we can do to make our communities fairer and safer for everyone. For my Dad, it was removing the seats at the segregated soda fountain. What will it be for you?

        "content_plain": "[1]Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate Im so proud of the campaign weve built together, Jenga. From launching this campaign last year on January 6 to calling out Josh Hawley on cable news to breaking Missouri fundraising records quarter after quarter, your support has helped us put a national spotlight on this U.S. Senate race. And now, multiple polls are showing that were in a neck-and-neck race with Josh Hawley the GOPs most unpopular U.S. Senator running in 2024. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]St. Louis Post-Dispatch headline: New poll touts Lucas Kunce's chance of upsetting Josh Hawley. Two polls beneath. Poll 1: Lucas Kunce 43%, Josh Hawley 44%, Margin of Error +/- 3% | Poll 2: Lucas Kunce 42%, Josh Hawley 46%, Margin of Error 4.9% In a moment, Im going to ask you to add your first donation of any amount toward my campaign to defeat Hawley and flip Missouris U.S. Senate seat. But first, please let me share a little more about how we got here. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]ADD A DONATION NOW [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Lucas as a child, sitting with his family on the porch of his childhood home. I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, times had never been tougher. But we werent alone our community took care of us. When my parents had to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat. Thats the Missouri I grew up in. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1004 ]Photos of Lucas in uniform. Their support helped send me to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything they had done for me and my family growing up. Got deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Later the Pentagon. I was on the Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia. When I came home between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest things was seeing what was happening back in my old neighborhood. It was a community picked for parts the local corner store boarded up, my first family house bulldozed to the ground. Heres all thats left of it: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1005 ]The empty lot where Lucas' childhood home once stood. While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies for the industries that stripped our communities for parts like Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil and then told us they cant figure out how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and investing in our own people. I saw what was happening and I was ready to fight back. So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an organization that fights corporate monopolies we took on defense contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind. And now, Im running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and fundamentally change who has power in our country so everyday people call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a Marshall Plan for the Midwest a massive investment and job creation program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil fuels once and for all. I want to codify Roe v. Wade, secure voting rights, and ban anti-union Right-to-Work scams forever. I want to put working people in charge of our country. But I need your help to get it done. Without a single cent of corporate PAC money, were building the people-powered movement thats going to defeat Josh Hawley and flip this Senate seat and I need you on our team. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1006 ]Please add a donation of any amount right now so we can continue building this movement and finally give power back to everyday, working people.

Josh Hawley is vulnerable. In 2018, he won his seat with only 51% of the vote and after he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January 6th, he became the least popular Republican Senator up for re-election in 2024. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1010 ]Approval Ratings | U.S. Senate Public Polling By Morning Consult of 2024 GOP Senate Incumbents Ted Cruz (TX): 48%, March 2022 | 48%, July 2023 | 48%, October 2023 Rick Scott (FL): 49%, March 2022 | 47%, July 2023 | 46%, October 2023 Josh Hawley (MO): 46%, March 2022 | 44%, July 2023, 43%, October 2023 Since Hawley was elected, Missourians have broken with him and taken back their power at the ballot box by voting to raise the minimum wage, expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, and legalize cannabis. And if were able to communicate to voters early in this race that our campaign is about taking this U.S. Senate seat back for real Missourians, we have a real shot at defeating Josh Hawley. But I need you on this team to get it done, Jenga. GOP insiders and even Hawleys own campaign have already started attacking me and over the coming months, theyre bound to get even more vicious. Thats why we need to start preparing right now to fight back and deliver our positive message to voters. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1011 ]Will you chip in anything you can right now so we can keep building this record-breaking grassroots movement and stay prepared for the fight ahead?

He has such a rich understanding of the founding principles of our country and of constitutional law and history that the words of the founding fathers frequently flow from his lips to our ears as he recounts the teachings of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and other founders. That he remembers their words in perfect detail is a testament not only to his intellect but also to his patriotism. If you have heard Jonathan speak, you have seen this remarkable talent in action. Everyone who knows Jonathan well knows he loves his country far more than himself. He will save it from Tim Kaine and the communist agenda, but he cannot do it alone. He needs you. He needs us. Our family supports his cause. Every freedom loving American should too. Please go on record right now with your support for Jonathan by donating generously before the deadline of midnight tonight.

Ive watched their community go downhill for years. While corrupt politicians shipped jobs overseas and voted to give handouts to Wall Street and their corporate allies, everyday people just trying to survive in the place they call home ran out of money and opportunities. Our leaders abandoned them and Josh Hawley is the perfect example. Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in out-of-touch culture wars and selling us his book all about manhood telling the whole world that the only way to be a man is to be exactly like him. Well when I think about manhood, I think about courage. And thats not something you can give speeches or write a book about. Missouri is the Show Me State. Courage is something you have to show us. Thats why Im supporting Lucas Kunce for Missouris U.S. Senate seat. As a born-and-raised Missourian who joined the Marines to serve the community that took care of him growing up, Lucas has already shown us that he knows the true meaning of courage. Lucas knows courage is about standing up to the powerful and working to rebuild our state. And he knows real leaders fight to empower everyday people and secure our future for generations to come not for their own power or profit.

Bob is a fierce advocate for working families in Pennsylvania and across the country and, right now, hes facing the toughest campaign of his career. This is going to be one of the closest Senate races of 2024, and the stakes couldnt be higher. Mitch McConnell and national Republicans have zeroed in on Pennsylvania as a must-win Senate race in their mission to take back the majority. Theyre preparing to do everything they can to regain Senate control by coming after Bob and flipping Pennsylvania red. Not only that, but Bobs opponent, David McCormick, has the ability to self-fund. That means PA could see even more political spending than it did in 2022 and I dont think you need me to remind you that they spent a record-breaking $381 million in PA last time around. We need to stand with Bob to keep a real Pennsylvanian in the Senate, and defend our Democratic majority.

You may know me better for my role as advertising executive Don Draper on the show Mad Men, but today Im writing to talk to you about Adam Schiff and why we need to support his run for Californias Senate seat. I believe that this election for Californias next U.S. Senator will shape the course of our democracy for many years to come. We need to elect someone who wont back down from a tough fight and knows how to get things done. The twice-impeached, four-times-indicted ex-presidents recklessness and impulsiveness put this country in peril several times, and we must take him seriously as a threat to our democracy. Yet time and again, very few have held him accountable for his actions. Adam Schiff has. Again and again. Over the years, Ive watched Adam do the important work to investigate Trump, lead the impeachment trial, and hold his feet to the fire for the January 6th insurrection. Adam has shown that he doesnt back down from big fights. Hes defended our democracy and our shared values throughout his career, and hell keep up those fights in the Senate. But Trump and his cronies also know this, Jenga. Thats why they continue to attack Adam on television, on social media, and at their campaign rallies. Electing Adam to the U.S. Senate would be their worst nightmare so I need your help to make sure thats exactly where Adam ends up. So what do you say, Jenga? Will you contribute any amount to Adams U.S. Senate campaign today so that he can overcome baseless MAGA attacks, win this election, and lead the fight for progress in the Senate?

I know we just came off a big push, but this is important. So please: Can you make a donation to tell Kari Lake shell never step foot on the Senate floor?

Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I'm proud to serve Nevada and our country.And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help. Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control.

Thats about 10x the money we have attributed to the special election, because when we say this campaign is people-powered, we mean it.

Chris is committed to running a true grassroots campaign because he knows that power comes from the people. Building a people-powered movement from top to bottom makes us that much more powerful and capable of making real change in Washington. The truth is most members of Congress rake in a ton of money from corporate and special interest PACs. For his Senate colleagues, this usually adds millions of dollars for their reelection. But Chris is not taking a dime from ANY PACs. Thats a big change from how Washington thinks we should run this campaign. Hes the first to admit that he took this money previously. But its not worth it to him. Special interests and corporations shouldnt get special access, and he wants to make it 100% clear that working families always have and always will come first for him. So this leaves a lot of money on the table, and thats where we need you. When all of us give just a little bit, it adds up quickly. We know not everyone can contribute each time, but thats what makes your donation that much more important. So please: Can you make a contribution to Chris Murphys reelection today? Every dollar makes a difference to our efforts to hold the Senate majority and make progressive change in Washington.

Over of New Jersey voters dont know who Tammy is, yet! Another have heard of her but havent formed an opinion. We have just over five months to change that about 150 days to show people who Tammy is and why shes the right woman to lead New Jersey forward. But in the most crowded and expensive media market in the nation, thats going to take a lot of resources, and fast. Can you please chip in tonight, before our first end-of-month deadline, to ensure Tammy has the resources to reach every voter? Your donations support TV ads, online outreach, organizing, and all our other work to connect with voters. DONATE NOW >> Tammy has so many stories to tell and victories to share with the voters of New Jersey. She played a leading role in bringing climate change curricula to our schools. She worked with doulas, patients, and health care providers to reduce deaths during childbirth especially in Black and Brown communities and shes on the front lines fighting attacks on our reproductive freedom. Shes done so much for New Jersey, and I know if we reach folks with those stories, they will turn out and vote for her. But we're up against multiple DC insiders with deep pockets from years of politicking. Theyre attacking Tammy already, and we need to reach voters before they do. Thats why Im calling on you now:Please rush a donation before tomorrows fundraising deadline to ensure we can introduce Tammy to voters before our opponents can attack her on TV.

That means telling you I could lose our race for the U.S. Senate. Two December polls show me being pushed out of the primary. That means my time in Congress would come to an end. Heres why: California has a unique system. The top two vote-getters in Marchs primary advance to the general election in November. Early polling suggests that I am in a very strong position to win the general election, no matter the other candidate, but the math in this primary is weird. A celebrity Republican is gaining traction in the polls, and he could advance to second place and keep us from qualifying for the general election. Election Day is less than five weeks away, but Californians begin voting even sooner. Ballots get mailed out next week, and with 20% of voters undecided, theres no time to waste. Just a single adwhether on TV or onlinecan change a voter's mind or inspire them to get their ballot in. The race between first, second, and third place will likely be decided by just a few percentage points. With so little time to reach voters (and less than 24 hours to reach our January goal) can you pitch in today? Donate Thanks for being a part of our team.

You can purchase a ticket for as low as $25 (which goes straight to supporting my campaign!) here.

But that doesn't mean that we can lose our momentum for even a single moment. I'm laser-focused on getting out the vote on the ground, but to do that, I need more resources to fund this massive grassroots operation. So I have to ask, to help me make history and bring my battle-tested progressive record to the Senate: Will you join me at my exclusivegrassroots event tomorrow evening and help support my historic campaign?

Please let me explain: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]Tweet from Josh Hawley on June 24, 2022: For those who wondered why I said, two years ago, I would vote to confirm ONLY Supreme Court Justices who acknowledged Roe was wrong, this is why. Amy Barrett was the first openly pro-life nominee of my lifetime. And she was the deciding vote. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]DEFEAT JOSH HAWLEY IN 2017: Matt Kacsmaryk was nominated to be a federal judge for the north Texas district court. His confirmation stalled for years. We learned he even lied to hide just how bizarre his obsession with controlling peoples bodies really is: [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]Headline from The Dallas Morning News: John Cornyn says Judge Kacsmaryk should not have taken name off anti-abortion article. Excerpt: 'The process only works if we. have candor and truthful answers. So that's significant,' said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee responsible for vetting Kacsmaryk's nomination. IN 2018: While his nomination languished in the Senate, Kacsmaryk made an investment in his future. So he became a campaign donor to Josh Hawley, a fellow member of the Federalist Society a group of corporate activist lawyers with funders including Chevron, Google, and the Kochs. IN 2019: Now a U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley decided to make Kacsmaryk, his campaign donor, a federal judge. Hawley confirmed Kacsmaryk to the northern Texas district court despite bipartisan opposition over Kacsmaryks Big Brother views on contraceptives and personal freedoms. IN 2022: A lawsuit was filed in the northern Texas district court by activist lawyers seeking to ban an abortion pill that millions have used safely. Abortion medication accounts for over half of all abortions. Josh Hawleys wife led the suit. His donor was the judge. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1004 ]Photos of Josh Hawley and Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk on the left. On the right, a Vanity Fair headline that reads: Erin Morrow Hawley is leading the charge to ban abortion medication. She's also Josh Hawley's wife. APRIL 2023: Hawleys donor judge ruled in favor of the suit led by Hawleys wife, calling for a near-immediate ban on the abortion pill mifepristone in all 50 states. This was the first time a judge has ever unilaterally tried to take a drug off the market against FDA objections. Then, in his official capacity as U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley submitted an amicus brief demanding that the Supreme Court end a temporary injunction blocking the ruling (in his wife's lawsuit) by a judge (his campaign donor) to ban America's most commonly-used abortion medication. AND NOW: Weve learned that the mifepristone case, led by Hawleys wife, will be argued in front of the Supreme Court on March 26. [ Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1005 ]POLITICO headline: Supreme Court sets date for high-stakes abortion pill oral arguments. Excerpt: The Supreme Court on Monday set a date for one of the highest-stakes and closest-watched cases of the term announcing it will hear oral arguments on how patients can access mifepristone, the commonly used abortion pill, on March 26. But this is hardly the first time that the Hawley family business has made it all the way to the Supreme Court: This is what corruption looks like and this year, were going to make Hawley own it.

Here's the bad news: My Trump-backed opponent is fighting back with TV ads of his own and if we don't raise $100,000 by midnight tonight, we may not have the resources we need to keep up. This is where you come in: With Senate control on the line, the GOP will be pulling out all the stops to defeat me.

I'm running a true grassroots campaign, which means I'm counting on folks like you to power our reelection campaign to victory. That's why I'm asking directly: Will you please chip in $5 or more now as much as you can spare by midnight so we can keep our new ad live,fight back against GOP attacks, and keep this Senate seat blue?

        "content_plain": "Jenga, it's Chuck Schumer. I'm reaching out to ask you to help my friend Kirsten Gillibrand. Will you give me a moment to explain? I'm incredibly proud to call Kirsten my friend,colleague, and fellow New York senator. From her very first day serving in Congress back in 2007, she's been one of Washington's strongest voices for progress. Now, as senator, she's on the frontlines of the fights that matter most to families. But as the 2024 election heats up, GOP megadonors are targeting Kirsten's seat for defeat. And right now, she's falling short of her critical $50,000 end-of-month goal. So I have to ask: Will you donate $5 or more before midnight to help Kirsten make up the gap and protect her must-win Senate seat? Please, Jenga, we need Kirsten's voice in the Senate especially with far-right extremists threatening the rights and progress that we've fought so hard to win. Trust me on this: Kirsten deliversresults.Over the last couple of years, she's won legislation to reform our military's criminal justice system, protect survivors of sexual harassment and assault, expand benefits for veterans and 9/11 first responders, crack down on gun trafficking, and tackle corruption in Washington. Now, she's leading the charge to win guaranteed paid family leave, certify the Equal Rights Amendment, restore reproductive rights, protect seniors, and so much more. I've had the privilege of working closely with Kirsten on these issues and so many others. I've seen her fight harder than just about anyone else to build coalitions across the aisle, block dangerous bills, and get her legislation across the finish line. And I'm not exaggerating here: While in the House, Kirsten gave birth to her second son mere hours after working a 13-hour day. Kirsten is one of a kind. And families in New York and across the nation need her voice in Washington advocating for their rights, priorities, and futures. But that's why the GOP is ready to do everything within their power to defeat her this fall. New York Republicans celebrated their best election cycle in decades in 2022. Their extremist candidates flipped enough seats in the midterms to win control of the House and came within single digits of winning the governorship. Now, they're directly targeting Kirsten's seat to retake Senate control. I know that my friend has what it takes to defeat the GOP and their megadonors. But because she refuses to accept money from corporate PACs, she's counting on strong grassroots support to win this critical race. So please, before her end-of-month deadline, will you rush a donation to help Kirsten defend her seat and continue to fight for progress for families in the Senate? Thank you for taking the time to support my friend and help defend our Senate majority. With gratitude, Chuck Schumer - This email was sent to Jengabuilding90@gmail.com.

With this race becoming one of the most expensive in the country, I have to fight for every single dollar to pull ahead in the polls. $5 doesn't seem like much. But if every person reading this pitches in $5, we can build a powerful grassroots movement that can go toe to toe with the millions my opponents have raised from out-of-state donors and special interest lobbyists. That's why my team and I set a daily goal to raise $25,000 by midnight, and we're still falling short. So I'm personally asking: Can you chip in $5 to help me spread my message of a progressive future to voters everywhere? My opponents outraised me last quarter, and we can't afford to fall short again. Friend, recent polling shows this race is still up for grabs, with over 20% still undecided. But with my opponents bringing in millions that they can use to drown out our grassroots message, I need to make sure I'm hitting my goal each day to stay competitive. Here's the good news: I'm the true progressive in this race. If we can just reach enough California voters with my vision of progress and justice, I'm certain we can build a country that works for all of us. But I can't do it without this movement powering my fight, $5 at a time. Please: Will you give $5 right now so I can hit my $25,000 daily fundraising goal to pull ahead and take the lead in this race?

That could enable our opponents to strike back, or potentially encourage them to recruit a challenger against me to try to put a stop to our plans. As a reminder, the plans were fighting for would stop. *MAGA extremists from engaging in voter suppression, overturning election results, and taking away our rights *Quality child care from eating up an entire paycheck *Big bank CEOs from gambling with working peoples livelihoods *The filibuster from blocking bills that most Americans are calling for, like protecting abortion rights and enacting gun safety laws And they would start. *Making multi-millionaires and billionaires pay a small wealth tax on fortunes greater than $50 million so all of our kids can have a fighting chance at success *Restoring public trust in our nations highest court by getting Supreme Court justices to follow a basic code of ethics (and at least four more new justices will follow those rules once we expand the Court, too) *Bringing down the cost of housing by increasing supply *Rooting corruption out of Washington A contribution of $28 or any amount you can give right now will help ensure we can advocate and grow momentum for these plans from the halls of the Senate and all across the country.

While serving as the president of Nevada's largest synagogue, I was recruited to run in a competitive House race to help flip a red seat blue. Looking back, it's incredibly fitting that this was my entry point to public service because my Judaism helps guide much of my work in the Senate today. In fact, my decision to say \"yes\" and run for public office in the first place was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam which means to leave the world a better place than how we found it. Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I'm proud to serve Nevada and our country.And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help. Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control.

        "content_plain": "Hi everyone, As we step into Black History Month, I want to tell you the story of a soda fountain in the segregated South before 1964. At that time, barely fifty years ago, Black customers werent even allowed to sit in the same seats as white customers. Thanks to heroes like Dr. King and Fannie Lou Hamer, change was slowly spreading across America. But change hadnt yet come to many small southern towns. Even the seats at the soda fountain were still segregated until one worker decided he was tired of waiting for that to change. He thought that if his Black customers werent allowed to sit, then nobody should be, and he removed every single seat in that shop. Until everyone could sit as equals, theyd all just have to stand. The man who removed those seats was my Dad, and I think about what he did often. Dad believed we all have a role to play in making change for the benefit of all, and by removing those seats, he found a common-sense solution to address an injustice. **Photo of Tammy Murphy and her father after Tammy's college graduation. Tammy is in a cap and gown holding a diploma, and her dad is beaming with pride.** Fifty years later, weve come a long way from the days of segregation, but we have a long way to go still. Systemic racism lives on, and we all have a role to play in fighting back against it. Its why I made combating racial disparities in maternal and infant health the key issue of my time as First Lady, and its driving my campaign for the U.S. Senate today. This month, lets celebrate men and women like Dr. King, Fannie Lou Hamer, John Lewis, and so many more, who have helped us come so far. But lets not stop there. Lets ask ourselves what small things we can do to make our communities fairer and safer for everyone. For my Dad, it was removing the seats at the segregated soda fountain. What will it be for you?

Was it supply chains, interrupted by war and the pandemic? Greedy corporations? Washingtons failure to act? All three played a role. And I was deeply disappointed that the Senate never even bothered to vote on my bill that would have made price-gouging by oil companies illegal. But in fall of 2022, armed with lots of data, I used a Congressional Hearing to get answers from an economist who confirmed what I saw the numbers pointing to: record, rising corporate profits were accounting for at least half of the higher prices consumers were paying. [IMG] Big corporations still are trying to play the victim heresaying theyre just passing on higher costs to customers. But oftentimes, thats BS. From July through September 2023, the most recent period we have data for, corporate profits were just shy of the record peak they reached in 2022. Collectively, big corporations are making more than a *trillion* dollars more every three months than they were in 2017. Its on Congress to rein in these corporations. Too many billionaires are getting richer while more and more families cant afford rent. And thats exactly why Im running for the U.S. Senate. Im the only Democrat in this race who has never taken a dime from corporate PACs, but now Im being outspent by my opponent who has taken these checks for decades. I need your support if were going to compete. Our January end-of-month deadline is Wednesday at midnight. Is there anything you can give today? Donate Thanks in advance. I cant do this without you!

Im not excluded from that statement. But what we should ask every single candidate, every day, is what they will do with that power. Prior to Trump being elected, I never considered running for office. I didnt work my way up to Congress or serve in student government. I was a law professor and consumer protection advocate who studied and saw how big corporations were cheating the rest of us. When I first ran for office in 2018, I was (and still am!) a single mom of three school age kids who drives a minivan. Now, Im running for the U.S. Senate because I want the power to go after the corrupt special interests that are making it difficult for families to get ahead. Oil companies need to be held accountable for their messes. Health insurance and pharmaceutical companies need to be held accountable for breaking laws, and for lobbying for a healthcare system that exists to serve their bottom lines. And corporations and the ultra-wealthy need to be held accountable when they cheat on their taxes. Our current system is not good enough, and its not going to be good enough to just go back to the way things were before Donald Trump. Ive never taken a dime from corporate PACs and I dont take money from federal lobbyistsyou can always count on me to fight for working people and shake up the status quo. My mentor and former law professor Elizabeth Warren taught me that nobody gets elected alone. Its true! I cant do this without you. Right now, were being outspent on TV ads by millions of dollars. With just five weeks until Election day, we urgently need to catch up. Can you chip in today? Donate Thanks so much for being a part of our campaign.

And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help. Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate has launched his campaign to defeat me, and recent polling shows me neck and neck with my GOP opponent in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking: If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you if you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we love will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

        "content_plain": "Jenga, big change starts small. That's a lesson that my grandmother, Polly Noonan, first taught me decades ago. Well before most women had any political power, my grandmother organized women into a political force in Albany. By the time I was in elementary school, I was tagging along with her to all kinds of Democratic campaign headquarters, rallies and events. She remains one of my biggest role models and I carry her wisdom with me to this day. She taught me that my voice matters, that womens voices matter and that grassroots activism matters. And she showed me how campaigns are won by the people who put in the work like the volunteers knocking doors, stuffing envelopes, turning out the vote and donating what they can, when they can. For decades, first by my grandmother's side and then as a public servant myself, I've seen how those small grassroots actions all add up to victory on Election Day. That's how Democrats defeated the odds in 2022 to defend and even expand our Senate majority. And that's why I know that we can win again in 2024. With Democrats defending 23 seats, the odds are certainly stacked against us. And after the 2022 red wave in New York, Republicans here are already targeting my seat for defeat. But when people like you get off the sidelines and chip in even just $3, eventually we'll build a grassroots movement capable of defeating even the GOP's wealthiest megadonors. So please, will you chip in $3 or $25 or whatever you can spare today to help save our Senate majority by building a grassroots movement one grassroots gift at a time? I refuse to accept money from corporate PACs, so these grassroots donations are truly critical to my campaign. Thank you for believing in the power of raising your voice and uniting together for change. With gratitude and love, Kirsten - This email was sent to Jengabuilding90@gmail.com.

I'm working every day to defend Medicare and Social Security, make high-quality health care more affordable, and ensure the courts work for the people. My Democratic colleagues and I are advancing President Bidens agenda, and were determined to pass more legislation that will grow and strengthen the middle class. I also dont shy away from a fight, particularly if it involves the big special interests trying to bend the government to do their bidding. This gets me some grief from right-wing circles, which is clearly a sign that they're feeling the heat. For years, Ive led the effort to expose the role of special interests and dark money in capturing our courts and killing legislation to address climate change, and I will continue to do so as long as anonymous billionaire donors are able to buy unlimited political influence. For a long time, I was one of the only people taking on this dark money apparatus, but other progressive voices have now joined in. I'm optimistic that were building the momentum to turn the tide, but our work is far from over. I hope you will stay in touch as we continue the fight.

Experts are calling this one of the most competitive Senate races in history, and with just hours left, Barbara Lee is still short of her $25,000 daily fundraising goal. If this team is going to help her compete with the millions her opponents have hauled in, we can't slow down our efforts now. So we're following up one last time: Please, will you donate whatever you can so that Rep. Lee can reach her midnight fundraising goal and defend our razor-thin Senate Democratic majority? Friend, Rep. Lee was incredibly honored to have received endorsements from giants in the progressive space, such as Rep. Ro Khanna, Stacey Abrams, Rep. Ayanna Pressley and more. Because endorsements like theirs will go a long way in swaying California's undecided voters. But heres the reality: We cant afford to take our foot off the gas not when recent polls show this race is starting to tighten. The only thing standing between Barbara Lee pulling ahead in this race is reaching more voters with her progressive message and that takes resources. So please, will you chip in $5 before midnight to help her reach this crucial $25,000 fundraising goal and take her fight for progress to the Senate?

New POLITICO reporting has detailed how these groups advise leveraging new rules at agencies like the FTC, FDA, and EPA, as well as using executive orders to slash abortion access nationwide without needing to receive Congressional approval. Theyre calling it the Heritage Foundations 2025 Presidential Transition Project. Its almost 1,000 pages long, and its authors include members of the first Trump administration, Students for Life, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and other anti-abortion organizations. Theyre also collecting resumes from conservative activists who are interested in becoming political appointees of these agencies to carry out these new anti-abortion measures themselves. This will enable the Trump administration to have everything and everyone it needs to carry out its goal of rescinding abortion rights everywhere nationwide no matter where you live. As these groups work on their plan, Ive got a plan too. To fight like hell to keep Trump out of the White House, work to re-elect President Biden, flip the House, and expand the Senate with more pro-choice Democrats. That way, well have the votes we need to codify abortion rights into federal law. Splitting a donation to our campaign and the Biden-Harris campaign today is one of the best ways to make sure that the Heritage Foundations 2025 Presidential Transition Project remains just a radical little pet project and never sees the light of day.

Jenga: From improving our nations infrastructure and helping create millions of new jobs to lowering health care costs and making college more affordable, President Biden has delivered real progress for the American people. But Republicans have been working overtime to attack the president and undermine all of his accomplishments. Now, polls show him locked in a statistical TIE with Donald Trump in the race for the White House! This is dangerous, Jenga. Trump has already attacked our democracy, and hes racked up a staggering 91 criminal charges since leaving office. He even said that he will be a dictator on \"day one\" if reelected. If Democrats dont stand united behind President Biden at this crucial moment, Donald Trump could win reelection and do irreparable harm to our country and democracy from within.

        "content_plain": "Folks its James Carville. Ill tell it like it is: Democrats are in BIG trouble. Ive been in politics for a long time, and youd be hard-pressed to find a map as tough as ours this year. Were defending the most delicate Senate majority Ive ever seen and Mitch McConnell and his extremist cronies are bound to use every trick up their sleeves to snatch back control. The GOP is coming at us with full force, and theyre going ALL IN on Nevada as a top target because they know this battleground is key to Senate control. And with polling already showing Jacky Rosen locked in a dead heat, its not looking good. Nevada is a must-win seat to protect the Senate again in 2024, but Jacky is falling behind her end-of-month fundraising goal, so can you please chip in $5 ASAP? Democrats barely won in the Silver State by a slim 7,928 votes last year, the closest Senate race in the countryso you can bet that Mitch McConnell and his far-right posse have a bone to pick. They have a massive, dark-money war chest behind them and are gearing up to drop millions and millions of dollars attacking Jackys reputation. The stakes couldnt be more clear. If Jacky Rosen loses in Nevada, Mitch McConnell and GOP extremists will take back the majority and make it their TOP priority to strip away our basic rights and pass a nationwide abortion ban. But its not all doom and gloom, friend. In my expert opinion, we can win this race and keep control of the Senate. That starts with raising the resources to prepare for the tough fight ahead of us. So, ahead of Jackys first end-of-month deadline of 2024, Im begging: Will you please join me and rush $5 so we can win this pivotal battleground state? The ball is in your court now. Thank you for stepping up at this make-or-break moment. James Carville - This email was sent to Jengabuiling90@gmail.com.

Thank you for having my back when we fought for health care coverage for 9/11 first responders and expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. We must ensure that our heroes get the care that they need. Thank you for supporting my hard-won legislation that empowers survivors of sexual assault in the militaryto seek justice. Together, we took on the Pentagon to win reforms that will create a fairer system for service members. Thank you for never giving up the fight to make gun trafficking a federal crime. After 14 years of advocacy, late nights and whipping votes, my legislation was finally passed in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Already, we're stopping the flow of illegal guns into New York. Thank you for your continued commitment to family rights and gender equity. With your support, I have spent the last decade fighting for national paid family leave for all workers. And now, I'm proud to lead the charge to add the Equal Rights Amendment to our Constitution which would finally give us the legal basis to restore reproductive rights across the country. My record is about winning real results for the families I swore to serve not for corporations or megadonors. And none of that would be possible without your continued, tireless support. But here's the bad news: Republicans are emboldened after their historic victories in New York in 2022. Now, they're laying the groundwork for an even bigger red wave in 2024 and they're directly targeting my seat. I refuse to accept a single cent from corporate PACs, so I'm relying on grassroots donors like you to compete with their right-wing megadonors. Please, Jenga, you've stood by me so many times before, and I'm counting on you to have my back again. Will you chip in before midnight tonight to join me in this fight for progress and defend our Senate majority? Your support would mean so much to me.

Wisconsin is home to some of the most competitive elections in the country and Tammy Baldwins reelection race this year is shaping up to be no different. Last month, Senate Republicans threw their support behind Eric Hovde, the right-wing megamillionaire who is gearing up to enter Wisconsins Senate race. As soon as he launches his campaign, hell bring with him a campaign war chest fueled by at least $20 million of his own personal fortune. Thats the kind of cash that can tilt the scales when elections are won and lost by less than a percentage point. I know this campaign has what it takes to reelect Tammy Baldwin, defeat Eric Hovde, and keep Wisconsin blue. But we need to start building resources now to prepare to compete against Hovdes cash advantage so Tammys campaign can reach voters, fight back against Republican attacks, and mobilize Democrats across the state. None of that can happen without your support, which is why Im reaching out to you today: Before tomorrows end-of-month deadline, will you make a donation to Tammys campaign to help her keep Wisconsin blue? She cant defend this toss-up Senate seat without your help: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: CHIP IN $5 NOW CHIP IN $10 NOW CHIP IN $25 NOW CHIP IN $50 NOW CHIP IN $100 NOW ANOTHER AMOUNT Were getting dj vu with Republicans like Eric Hovde following Ron Johnsons winning strategy from 2010 when Johnson announced late in the cycle to avoid disclosing his personal finances for as long as possible and fueled his campaign with his own personal fortune, before defeating Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold.

The Team Emord petition drive is in full swing. Across the Commonwealth, 160 volunteers trained in the gathering process by our Petition Director Ann Parker are collecting hundreds of signatures in as many as six venues simultaneously. It is an incredible sight to behold and proof that the Emord campaign has the most extensive grassroots support of any candidate for U.S. Senate. And Team Emord is everywhere! Join our volunteer force; become part of the movement to Save Virginia and Save America. Contact Ann Parker at ann@emordforva.com This past week, on January 15, Jonathan received an enthusiastic reception and strong support at the Bell Tower on the Capitol grounds, speaking to members and supporters of Virginia Medical Freedom Alliance. Endorsed by the 750,000 strong Stand for Health Freedom, Jonathan pledged to introduce legislation to ban all mask and vaccine mandates and to compel all federally funded hospitals, police departments, fire departments, and the military to rehire and re-enlist those forced out by the mandates, give them back pay, and the promotions otherwise due them. The speech received rave reviews and came on the one-year anniversary of his original announcement of his Emord for Senate exploration from that very same spot. [image: Virginia Medical Freedom Alliance] < On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Williamsburg Breakfast Club to an enthusiastically supportive reception. This is his third appearance before the Club and members know him well and like him well too. On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Newport News GOP. Once again, the support for Emord for Senate was incredible. On January 17, Jonathan was interviewed by Joe Thomas of WCHV in Charlottesville. He discussed Kaines voting record of support for inflationary spending, open borders, and woke policies in the schools. Jonathan explained that Virginia and the nation must reverse course or face years more of ruin from the Biden/Kaine far left agenda. On January 17, Jonathan spoke before the Yorktown Breakfast Club. Members asked questions and Jonathan delighted those in attendance with his characteristic direct and detailed responses, revealing the breadth of his understanding, experience, and legal and persuasive skills. Several mentioned to the Team that they could not wait for Jonathan to debate Kaine. On January 17, Jonathan signed copies of his books and spoke to patrons at the Book Owl Bookstore in Portsmouth, Virginia. Members of the public were intrigued to learn of Jonathans agenda and many expressed strong support. On January 18, Jonathan addressed the Newport Breakfast Club. Once again, members asked probing questions and enjoyed hearing Jonathan reveal not only clear mastery of a wide range of subjects but also detailed legislative solutions to the problems facing the nation. As in each location before, the support for Emord for Senate is very strong in Newport News. On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by Dr. Jason Dean on Brave TV. They discussed the disastrous open border policy and the union between Biden, Kaine, and globalists intent on destroying the American republic and replacing it with a totalitarian global government. On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show, as he is every Thursday. They discussed the pressing issues of the day. On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by TNT Radio on its State of the Nation live broadcast. Jonathan explained in detail his agenda for saving Virginia and America and received the on air endorsements of the programs two hosts. On January 18, Jonathan spoke before the Gloucester County Republican Committee. Members repeatedly advised the campaign of their support for Emord for Senate as the sweep across Virginia continues. On January 19, Jonathan was interviewed on Newsmax by host Rob Carson. < Jonathan explained his position on the J-6ers, reiterating that only those for whom there is direct evidence of violence or property destruction should be prosecuted. The vast majority should be immediately released. He explained that he will introduce legislation to grant immediate release and amnesty to those wrongfully arrested and incarcerated. No one should be jailed, let alone placed in solitary confinement, whose only crime may have been trespass. That is an abuse of prosecutorial discretion and proof that Justice has been perverted to attack Democrats political opponents. On January 20 and 21, Jonathan joined Team Emord at the Salem Gun Show, joining them in defending our 2nd Amendment rights. The Team interacted with hundreds of patrons and strong patriots. Jonathan will sponsor legislation to establish constitutional carry nationwide to end state and local efforts to deprive Americans of their right to keep and bear arms. THE CLOCK IS TICKING Our campaign to raise $50,000 by the January 31 deadline is underway. Donate what you can! Help get us past the finish line. Only days left. The clock is ticking.

Looking ahead to 2024, Democrats are facing our toughest election map in decades as we fight to defend the Senate and I'm facing an uphill battle to reelection after New York Republicans secured historic victories in the 2022 midterm elections. That's why I'm so grateful to have grassroots folks like you by my side. Youarethe reason we expanded our narrow majority in November, and youwill be the reason we protect it again next year. So today, I need to hear from you directly, because we want to keep your thoughts and priorities at the very center of our plans. Please, will you take a minute or two to share which issues are top of mind for you right now? Your insights will be critical to building a winning reelection strategy and defending the Senate for Democrats. When it comes to getting things done for you and your family, I've never backed down from a tough fight, and I never will. The challenges our country is facing are too urgent and the stakes are simply too high to sit on the sidelines. There is still so much left to do to address the climate crisis, establish national paid leave, expand access to affordable health care, bolster voting rights and defend reproductive freedom. But I can't continue these fights without your help: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that the GOP has a clear path to retaking the Senate majority, and its already targeting my seat after winning races across New York last November. That's why it's so important that I hear from you today. Please, will you take our brief priorities survey to share your thoughts with me directly? Thank you. I'm so grateful to have you on our team.

        "content_plain": "Jenga, Kirsten Gillibrand is running for reelection so that she can keep delivering results for families like yours. Here's the latest update on Kirsten and this must-win race. FIRST: Kirsten announced new legislative efforts to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, restore abortion rights nationwide, pass paid family leave, empower seniors and end government corruption. THEN: New York Republicans ramped up their attacks on Kirsten! After powering a huge red wave in 2022, they're more determined than ever to defeat Kirsten and flip the Senate red right here in New York. NOW: Kirsten is facing her first end-of-month goal of 2024, and she's falling $9,447 short with less than 48 hours left! GOP extremists are watching Kirsten and her campaign like hawks. At even the smallest sign of weakness, they won't hesitate to flood the airwaves with attacks. That's why Kirsten is counting on a surge in grassroots support in the next few hours to get back on track to hit this goal. Please, will you rush $5 or more right now to make sure that Kirsten can defend her must-win seat and continue to deliver progress for families? - This email was sent to Jengabuilding90@gmail.com.

        "content_plain": "Im grateful beyond belief. Only yesterday, I told you I was in danger of missing my very FIRST End of Month Deadline of 2024. But my campaign manager just called to tell me that with only 12 hours left we are about to pull off an unprecedented comeback. I only need 2 more gifts from your city in these final hours to reach my critical End of Month goal, fund my campaign to defeat extremist Kevin Cramer, and FLIP this seat for Democrats. Can I count on you to chip in $15 and help me pull this off before midnight? I dont accept a cent of Corporate PAC money, which means my campaign relies on everyday folks chipping in whatever they can to hit our goals and win this race. >> [ Im running to fight for working and middle-class folks who have been left behind by Kevin Cramer for far too long. Im so proud to have a grassroots team behind me thats just as determined as me to flip this seat and prove once and for all that Cramers days voting against our families are numbered. But, Im facing the first major test of the election year. Cramers corporate donors are watching for any sign of weakness and National Democrats are looking to see if we have enough support to pull off a win. I need your help to prove that we are a force to be reckoned with and build a campaign we can all be proud of. I cant overstate how important this deadline is. So Im asking one last time: Can I count on you to rush in $15 and help me close this fundraising gap before my first End of Month Deadline of the year hits in 12 hours? >> [ Thanks for all your support, Katrina Friends of Katrina Christiansen P.O. Box 833 Jamestown, ND 58402 United States Paid for by Friends of Katrina Christiansen Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. Thats why shes running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table. Katrina doesnt take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so shes relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?
