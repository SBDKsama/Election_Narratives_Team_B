It's been a long day, friend, so I'll jump right in: If Democrats lose in Nevada, we will lose our Senate majority. Full stop.
That's why hitting our fundraising goals – and having the resources to defeat the GOP – is so critical. But unfortunately, I just got word from my team that we're still $5,274 short of our end-of-month goal with just 3 hours left until the midnight deadline. 
So please, this is the last call: Will you chip in $5 – even $25 – right now to keep Nevada and the Senate blue?

Jenga: Sen. Sherrod Brown is fighting every day for the Dignity of Work. Whether you punch a time clock or swipe a badge, work for tips or earn a salary, are raising children or caring for an aging parent, he'll fight for you.
But as you read this, Sherrod is neck and neck with his self-funding GOP opponents, one of whom just spent $2 MILLION to flood the airwaves with TV ads and flip this seat.
That's why we're fighting back with a TV ad of our own – but if we don't raise $100,000 by midnight, we may need to pull back. With Senate control on the line, we can't afford to cede the airwaves to the GOP and get drowned out.

No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you.

Biden administration proposes to close loophole on background checks
Jenga: President Biden, Sen. Gillibrand and other Democratic leaders are fighting to expand background checks and protect communities nationwide from gun violence. But they need grassroots activists like you to stand with them. 
Please, will you add your name before 11:59 p.m. tonight to show your support for background checks? We're counting on 10,000 activists to add their names!

Jenga, America is in the midst of a gun violence epidemic. There have already been more than 30 mass shootings in 2024 alone. Our children and communities are living in fear of gun assailants and violence every day. But it doesn't have to be this way.
There are simple gun safety reforms that we know will curb gun violence and make our communities safer. The vast majority of Americans support basic reforms like expanded background checks. 
Gun safety legislation shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's about protecting communities and preventing senseless deaths. But the far-right gun lobby is spending MILLIONS each year to stop commonsense legislation from becoming the law of the land. And each year, the cycle of mass shootings and violence continues.
That's why Democrats are fighting to finally make a change and pass universal background checks! This would be a major step forward to a safer future — and we're counting on grassroots activists like you to join these Democratic leaders in standing up to the gun lobby. Please, will you add your name before midnight tonight to show your support for expanded background checks?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 – and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

   Hawley on cable news to breaking Missouri fundraising records quarter

   home.
   I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family
   lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart
   condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no
   money left, times had never been tougher.
   But we weren’t alone — our community took care of us. When my parents had

   While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah,
   Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country
   waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies
   for the industries that stripped our communities for parts — like Wall
   Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil — and then told us they can’t figure out
   how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and
   investing in our own people.
   I saw what was happening — and I was ready to fight back.
   So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate
   defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an
   organization that fights corporate monopolies — we took on defense
   contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying
   off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind.
   And now, I’m running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and
   fundamentally change who has power in our country — so everyday people
   call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to
   abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war
   profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a
   Marshall Plan for the Midwest — a massive investment and job creation
   program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil
   fuels once and for all.
   I want to codify Roe v. Wade, secure voting rights, and ban anti-union
   “Right-to-Work” scams forever. I want to put working people in charge of
   our country. But I need your help to get it done.
   Without a single cent of corporate PAC money, we’re building the
   people-powered movement that’s going to defeat Josh Hawley and flip this
   Senate seat — and I need you on our team.

   Josh Hawley is vulnerable. In 2018, he won his seat with only 51% of the
   vote — and after he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January
   6th, he became the least popular Republican Senator up for re-election in
   2024.

I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, times had never been tougher.
But we weren’t alone — our community took care of us. When my parents had to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat. That’s the Missouri I grew up in.
Their support helped send me to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything they had done for me and my family growing up. Got deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Later the Pentagon. I was on the Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia.

   “Supporting Josh Hawley was… the worst decision I’ve ever made in my
                                     life.”
   Jenga — that’s
   a real quote from Josh Hawley’s former mentor, Missouri’s three-term GOP
   U.S. Senator Jack Danforth. Here’s what happened:
                          [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43272?refcode=em20240131-4723&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4723%2E1040133%2E6BzBpz Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN →
   FIRST — In 2018, former Missouri Senator Jack Danforth recruited Josh
   Hawley to run for U.S. Senate. Danforth even cleared the crowded field of
   Republican challengers in Hawley’s primary.
   THEN — On January 6, 2021, Josh Hawley showed the world that he’s a coward
   and a fraud by raising his fist then running for his life at the U.S.
   Capitol.
   NOW — Danforth and a handful of Hawley’s other mentors + mega-donors are
   refusing to support his re-election campaign — and recent reports from
   Morning Consult found Hawley’s approvals plummeting among Missouri voters.
   Republicans and Democrats across Missouri agree: We can’t afford another
   six years of Josh Hawley representing us in the U.S. Senate.
                          [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43272?refcode=em20240131-4723&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4723%2E1040133%2E6BzBpz Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN →
   Now here’s why we need your help,
   Jenga:
   Every dollar we raise gives us an opportunity to keep exposing Hawley as a
   fraud and a coward — and allows us to reach voters with Lucas’
   election-winning message every day between now and November 5.
   That’s what it’ll take to win this race. So now we’re asking you:

   can hit our $400,000 end-of-month fundraising goal, get Lucas’ message in
   front of Missouri voters, and continue to hold Josh Hawley accountable for
   embarrassing our state and betraying our country? Lucas doesn’t take a
   cent from corporate PACs, so your support today really will make a big
   impact on our grassroots campaign.

“Supporting Josh Hawley was… the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life.”
Jenga — that’s a real quote from Josh Hawley’s former mentor, Missouri’s three-term GOP U.S. Senator Jack Danforth. Here’s what happened:
DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN →
FIRST — In 2018, former Missouri Senator Jack Danforth recruited Josh Hawley to run for U.S. Senate. Danforth even cleared the crowded field of Republican challengers in Hawley’s primary.
THEN — On January 6, 2021, Josh Hawley showed the world that he’s a coward and a fraud by raising his fist then running for his life at the U.S. Capitol.
NOW — Danforth and a handful of Hawley’s other mentors + mega-donors are refusing to support his re-election campaign — and recent reports from Morning Consult found Hawley’s approvals plummeting among Missouri voters.
Republicans and Democrats across Missouri agree: We can’t afford another six years of Josh Hawley representing us in the U.S. Senate.
DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN →
Now here’s why we need your help, Jenga:
Every dollar we raise gives us an opportunity to keep exposing Hawley as a fraud and a coward — and allows us to reach voters with Lucas’ election-winning message every day between now and November 5.
That’s what it’ll take to win this race. So now we’re asking you:
Can you chip in $10 or just whatever you can today so we can hit our $400,000 end-of-month fundraising goal, get Lucas’ message in front of Missouri voters, and continue to hold Josh Hawley accountable for embarrassing our state and betraying our country? Lucas doesn’t take a cent from corporate PACs, so your support today really will make a big impact on our grassroots campaign.

=========================================Friend, let me tell you a story from my childhood that helped shape who I am today. And, if it inspires you, I'd appreciate it if you would make a donation to my historic campaign for Senate.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk999-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
When I was 15, after making the move from the deeply segregated South to California, I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But unfortunately, I didn't look like the kind of person that the selection committee would choose for the cheerleading team.
I could've just accepted my fate and given up there – but that's not the kind of person my mother, who was one of just 12 students to integrate her college, raised me to be. 
So instead, I partnered with the NAACP and despite pushback from the school administration, we were able to convince them to change the system from a selection process to an election process that would allow the whole school to vote. After trying out in front of the entire student body, guess what? I won. I became the first Black girl cheerleader at my school.
And even better, other girls of color took advantage of the new process and were able to become cheerleaders that year as well.
Barbara Lee proudly posing in her cheerleader uniform after successfully organizing the integration of her high school cheerleading team with the help of the NAACP.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk999-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
You see, friend, I've been working to break down barriers and dismantle unfair systems since I was just 15 years old – and I'm nowhere near done yet. 
That's why I'm running for Senate and I hope I can count on you to join me. On average, Black women fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do, so I truly need every dollar.
Please, will you donate whatever you can spare to my Senate campaign so I can build a progressive future for all?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk999-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Thank you for listening to my story.
Barbara Lee

Friend, let me tell you a story from my childhood that helped shape who I am today. And, if it inspires you, I'd appreciate it if you would make a donation to my historic campaign for Senate.
When I was 15, after making the move from the deeply segregated South to California, I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But unfortunately, I didn't look like the kind of person that the selection committee would choose for the cheerleading team.
I could've just accepted my fate and given up there – but that's not the kind of person my mother, who was one of just 12 students to integrate her college, raised me to be.
So instead, I partnered with the NAACP and despite pushback from the school administration, we were able to convince them to change the system from a selection process to an election process that would allow the whole school to vote. After trying out in front of the entire student body, guess what? I won. I became the first Black girl cheerleader at my school.
And even better, other girls of color took advantage of the new process and were able to become cheerleaders that year as well.
You see, friend, I've been working to break down barriers and dismantle unfair systems since I was just 15 years old – and I'm nowhere near done yet. 
That's why I'm running for Senate and I hope I can count on you to join me. On average, Black women fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do, so I truly need every dollar.
Please, will you donate whatever you can spare to my Senate campaign so I can build a progressive future for all?

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================                          [1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
   Gun violence is the number one cause of death for children in America.
More than cancer. More than suffocation. It is, of course, a uniquely American problem, and it wasn’t always like this.
Barely a year after Sandy Hook, the gun-death rate for children started to sky rocket. Today, for the first time in our history, guns outpace car accidents as the leading cause of death for children in America.
For most of your life and mine, car accidents have been the number one cause of death. What changed? With changes in laws and safety standards and innovation — from the government and the car industry, the number of deaths fell significantly.
This is why so many of us as parents worry every day. How is it possible that so many of my colleagues and the gun lobby look at these numbers and trends and allow it to continue? And more than that, they fan the flames with fear mongering all in the name of selling more guns.
How can we choose to do nothing when we know there are popular, commonsense ideas that can save lives?
And let’s be clear: it is a choice. But I will not stand by and let Washington ignore the daily carnage of this epidemic, and I cannot do this alone.
If you are with me in this fight, will you please contribute any amount you can afford today to send a powerful message to demand change? Every dollar will help me build a movement with the power to change our gun laws and save lives.
CONTRIBUTE: https://act.chrismurphy.com/go/709?t=1001&akid=1808%2E2494310%2EiwgIQS
Together, we’ve proven that our movement is far more powerful than the NRA. The overwhelming majority of Americans agree with us.
With your help, we passed the first meaningful gun safety legislation in 30 years. But we know more must be done, so we cannot let up.
Every best wish,
Chris Murphy

=========================================   Mornin. It’s Ruben. 
I’m writing to you early today to humbly ask if you can make a donation to help us hit our goal. Our first end-of-month deadline of the year hits at midnight tonight. This is an important deadline, and we can’t afford to come up short.
If you know how important this race is and how high the stakes are in this year’s elections, you can use this link to chip in:
Please contribute to help us win our campaign for U.S. Senate by clicking here. 
Otherwise, let me explain why this request is so important:
Every single race ratings service from Cook Political Report to CNN says that Arizona is one of the most likely states to change hands this year. 
Kari Lake is running an absolutely chaotic campaign, and she’s not losing any steam. She’s consolidating her grip on the state party, the national GOP is falling in line behind her, and she’s got the full support of Trump and the MAGA-right. 
Arizona is ground zero for Trump as he works to take back the White House, and it’s the most important seat in the country when it comes to control of the Senate. 
The GOP will drop millions to win here. No doubt about it. 
To fight back, we’ve got to hit every consecutive deadline goal we set, month after month. Tonight is one of those deadlines, and we’ve still got some progress to make to get there. 
I need you today. So please:
Can I count on you to chip in before our first end-of-month deadline of the year hits at midnight? I promise I wouldn’t be asking if this wasn’t critical to our chances this November.

My campaign to defeat Tim Kaine is really heating up (and the media are taking notice). On Tuesday of this week I released a statement on the loss of our servicemembers in Jordan. I point out the continuing failure of Joe Biden as Commander-in-Chief and the Biden Administration's missteps in the Middle East. You can read my full "No New Wars" statement HERE and we were pleased with the number of media outlets, both inside and outside of Virginia, that covered my position on this issue. We are also excited to release the new website for the Garcia for Virginia campaign. Learn more about my background, my positions on the important issues facing America, join a coalition and volunteer and if possible, please consider donating to our campaign. You can visit the new website HERE or click on the images below. I am back on the road again this week speaking at conservative events and Republican Committee meetings throughout the Commonwealth.

STATEMENT ON THE MIDDLE EAST AND 
BRAND NEW WEBSITE
 #BETTER TOMORROW
Dear Jenga,
Welcome to all our new readers and thank you to our long-time loyal friends that enjoy our bi-weekly newsletter. My campaign  to defeat Tim Kaine is really heating up (and the media are taking notice).
On Tuesday of this week I released a statement on the loss of our servicemembers in Jordan. I point out the continuing failure of Joe Biden as Commander-in-Chief and the Biden Administration's missteps in the Middle East. You can read my full "No New Wars" statement HERE and we were pleased with the number of media outlets, both inside and outside of Virginia, that covered my position on this issue.
            We are also excited to release the new website for the Garcia for Virginia campaign. Learn more about my background, my positions on the important issues facing America, join a coalition and volunteer and if possible, please consider donating to our campaign. You can visit the new website HERE or click on the images below.                    
I am back on the road again this week speaking at conservative events and Republican Committee meetings throughout the Commonwealth. No one will out hustle or work 24/7 to defeat Tim Kaine in 2024 like the Eddie Garcia Team!
Right now we are in the middle our signature petition drive to get on the ballot. Veronica below outlines our latest activities across the Commonwealth. If you can help with the effort, Veronica details how to get involved and any assistance is truly appreciated. You will meet and join with some wonderful people dedicated to our campaign for a Better Tomorrow! 
God Bless, my best wishes to you and your family and I look forward to seeing you soon on the campaign trail!
Eddie
P.S. ﻿please consider making a donation HERE to the campaign. Due to Bidenomics, our costs for gas, hotels, signs, and even bumper stickers are more expensive and your contribution is extremely important. Thank you!
         PLEASE DONATE TO OUR CAMPAIGN HERE TODAY

  MARCH FOR LIFE AND ARLINGTON GOP        
Dear Friends:
The Women United for Garcia coalition members, friends and volunteers had a fun (but cold) time showing our support for Eddie at the snowy March for Life in Washington. We also had a great opportunity to collect signatures from Virginians from across the Commonwealth attending the event.
The collection of thousands of signatures from voters is the #1 priority now for the Garcia Team. Last week I was at the Arlington County Republican Committee meeting gathering signatures and out of the blue, they asked meet to say a few words. Yes, I was nervous speaking but I know Eddie will be an outstanding US Senator representing Virginia!
If you can help collect signatures at upcoming events, please sign up to volunteer HERE and you will receive our weekly Volunteer Newsletter outlining locations where we need volunteers or just collect signatures in your neighborhood.
If you have any questions, our petition manager is Britton Ross (brittonross9@gmail.com). You can reach out to her or drop us a line at info@eddiegarciava.com if you can help in your local area. 
God Bless and thank you for all your support of Eddie's campaign,
Veronica
P.S. We are preparing for the Virginia Pro-Life Day March in Richmond on Wednesday, February 21st. If you can attend and volunteer, please let us know at info@eddiegarciava.com

"I was born in Texas, my family still live and work in Texas and I know first hand the struggles and dangers of an open border. I stand with Texas!" - Eddie Garcia
         Lots of miles on the truck in the last couple of weeks.  I enjoyed meeting and speaking with the Amherst, Rockbridge, Roanoke City, Waynesboro and Fairfax County GOP Committees; visited with the Massanutten Patriots in Harrisonburg; attended the Salem and Fredericksburg Gun Shows; enjoyed breakfast with the City of Elders (see below) and addressed the 3rd Congressional District Candidate Forum.  HERE is a snippet of my All American Agenda that I share with audiences.                         
The power of prayer.  I am humbled and forever thankful for the multitude of prayer warriors in City Elders of Augusta and Page counties for strengthening me spiritually!
I will be at Crossroads Baptist Church this Sunday in Fredericksburg (info below) and welcome any opportunity to speak with all faith-based organizations. Please reach out to Ashlie, our campaign scheduler (below) if I can visit.

   Jenga,
   I want to personally thank you for joining Team Casey. It’s because of
   thousands of grassroots supporters like you that we can hit the ground
   running this election year.
   Now, with 2024 officially in full swing, your continued support is more
   important than ever.
   Please believe me when I say that this year, the stakes are higher than
   ever before.
   We must hold the Senate majority so we can win these key fights:
   — The fight for our democracy and voting rights, for women’s rights, for
   workers’ rights.
   — The fight to lower costs.
   — The fight for economic freedom for workers.
   — The fight for children, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities.
   If my opponent wins this seat, Democrats will lose our Senate majority and
   put all these fights at risk.
   We cannot afford a GOP Senate majority, Jenga. It’s that simple.
   I will never back down from these fights, but I need your help.

   opponent? Between now and November, it’s going to take all of us working
   together to defend our Senate majority.
   There’s a tsunami of dark money heading our way from Mitch McConnell, my
   mega-millionaire opponent, and all the right-wing groups that are waiting
   in the wings to flip PA red.
   To fight back, I’m counting on grassroots supporters chipping in $5 at a
   time or whatever they can spare.

   this year’s most competitive and expensive Senate races on the map.

Kyrsten Sinema spent more than $200,000 of taxpayer money on private jets. 
Ruben flies Southwest. 
It’s no secret how Kyrsten Sinema raises her money. She’s got an army of billionaires behind her. 
Ruben funds this campaign with donations from folks like you. People who believe in this campaign and care about our Senate majority. 
Kyrsten Sinema needs to make a decision on whether or not she runs for Senate soon — real soon, in the next month. 
We have to be ready when she makes that decision. And with our first end-of-month deadline of the year hitting tomorrow at midnight, we don’t have any time to waste. 
Please: Make a donation to help fund Ruben’s campaign for U.S. Senate. We’ve got to be ready to face down both Kyrsten Sinema and Kari Lake when the time comes. Don’t leave anything to chance here.

Jenga , 
I came to America legally as a refugee and I paid this country back for its 
generosity with 25 years of service in Navy Special Operations.
But today, we have tens of thousands of illegal aliens from all over the 
world, entering our country every day.
Syria. Iran. China. Yemen. Haiti. Nigeria. 
They are military-aged men who hate America.
The Biden-Kaine Democrats are doing nothing to stop the flow. In fact, their 
open border policies serve as a “Welcome to America” sign, and here’s their 
endgame:
They want illegal immigrants to vote. They know they’ll vote Democrat. And 
that’s their ticket to a permanent majority and the unchecked control and power 
they crave.
Here’s my message to those who wish to come to the United States: Don’t ask 
for the American Dream if you don’t embrace the American laws and the American 
culture – I DID.
Friend, your contribution is hard at work taking our message across the 
Commonwealth. With less than 10 months until our Election Day showdown with 
career politician Tim Kaine, we need to up our game, and your continued support 
is urgently needed to bring home our victory.
Here’s our goal: Raise $30,000 in just 8 days. Can I count on your help to get 
there? <https://secure.winred.com/hung-cao-for-virginia/have-we-met-hf>
SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN TODAY 
<https://secure.winred.com/hung-cao-for-virginia/have-we-met-hf> 
Friend, we MUST start this year strong, because the D.C. Democrats know that 
Tim Kaine is vulnerable and wildly out-of-touch with Virginians, so they will 
pour tens of millions of dollars into this race to prop him up and win majority 
control of the U.S. Senate.
A shocking eight million illegal immigrants have come into our country during 
Joe Biden’s watch. That’s nearly the population of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia! It’s insanity!
More than 100,000 overdose deaths occurred last year from fentanyl trafficked 
through Mexico. That’s roughly the population of Roanoke. It’s an absolute 
tragedy! And a completely preventable one at that!
While the streets are saturated with this opioid-poison, President Biden has 
seen fit to commute the sentences of convicted meth and crack cocaine dealers. 
Biden’s soft-on-crime policies are wreaking havoc and ruining lives. Career 
politician Tim Kaine is along for the ride.
Senator Tim Kaine votes the Biden way nearly every time.
With Joe Biden in the White House, the world is on fire and the southern 
border is burning. Meanwhile Liberal Tim Kaine is offering his friend a match.
Friend, we are losing our country. We can’t let that happen.
That’s why I’m running for Senate . . . continuing my service after 25 years 
in the U.S. Navy . . . after deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia . . 
. after seeing what the Biden-Kaine Democrats are doing to this great country. 
They’ve turned our border into a war zone!
We must build the wall. We must use advanced technology to repel the illegal 
alien invasion. We must reinstate Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy for this 
reason:
IT WORKS!
It’s time for new leadership in Washington, D.C. and it’s time for Biden and 
Kaine to go.

I can’t thank you enough for your generous support. It’s inspiring. It’s 
strengthening. It’s already making a powerful difference because our campaign 
is making progress daily.
But as I said, it’s time to up our game. 
Knowing that Washington, D.C.-financed Tim Kaine is going into full attack 
mode, our campaign must find a way to raise $30,000 in the next 8 days.
Our campaign is aggressive because it must be. We’re taking our anti-Biden 
message to all 95 counties and 39 independent cities. We’re taking our 
anti-open border, anti-fentanyl message to all 8.7 million Virginians in 3.3 
million households. 
With your ongoing support, we’ll take Politician Tim Kaine to task for his 
nearly 100% pro-Biden voting record with Virginia’s seniors, veterans, farmers, 
small business owners, professionals, factory workers, and gun owners.
We’ve got a lot to do . . . and Election Day is less than 10 months away.
We’ve got a lot to raise . . . $30,000 and just 8 days to do it.
We’ve got the U.S. Senate to flip . . . and our victory here in Virginia will 
do it!
Your generous contribution will be a welcome sight at our headquarters.
Friend, I hope you can help.

=========================================Friend, can we talk about the state of this race for a moment? I'm ready to lay all my cards out.
The honest truth is that I'm up against opponents who have enough money in the bank to launch multimillion dollar TV ads. And I just don't have the resources to compete with them in California's insanely expensive media market.
But that isn't to say that all hope is lost. Listen, friend, as a Black woman, I always knew that I wouldn't raise the same amount as my opponents. On average, Black women fundraise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But I don't need to raise the most money in this race, because I have a powerful platform that is converting voters. 
That's why I know we can still do this. My opponents may be flooding the airwaves with TV ads, but that's not the only way to get out the vote. 
Instead, my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state. None of this is cheap. An average yard sign costs about $5. And with 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. 
But of course, I can't do this alone. There are only 31 days until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $25,000 to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California – and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help. 
So I'm humbly asking, to give my bid for Senate the best possible chance: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? Now is the time to dig deep so we can show wealthy elites that we CAN build a strong campaign from a grassroots team.

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

Fellow Conservative,
I’m not holding back or mincing words. There’s only one proven conservative in this race – that's me – and there’s far too much on the line here in Nevada and in our nation to allow a RINO to prevail in our Republican primary for U.S. Senate on June 11th. 
Sam Brown, being pushed by RINO King Mitch McConnell and his establishment campaign machine as a “frontrunner” in this race, is running for all the wrong reasons... 
Please step up today and show your support for CONSERVATIVE VICTORY! >>>

Sam Brown is a guy who has never held elected office, yet feels entitled to it. 
He once moved to Texas, ran for a U.S. House seat, promised to never leave, and then bolted as soon as he came in with less than 5 percent of the vote. 
He formed a business to collect COVID emergency assistance – with very shady books. 
He set up a PAC and raised money – also with very shady books. 
Now he refuses to debate anyone, and he recently “endorsed” President Trump out of sheer desperation to derail the conservative backlash against his candidacy. This guy spent MONTHS UPON MONTHS refusing to take a stand and support President Trump and our America First agenda! 
Let me be clear: Nothing is more precious than our freedom and personal liberty, and I will NEVER WAVER in the fight to restore and defend our great nation’s full promise. 
Let’s defeat the sellout establishment RINOs and woke left in 2024 >>>

=========================================Hi everyone, I’ll get straight to the point.
Tonight is a really important moment for our campaign: our first monthly fundraising deadline of 2024. We’re still about 58 donations short of where we need to be, and I’m hoping you can take a moment to chip in.
Hitting monthly goals like this is crucial to running this campaign on our terms. We rely on your support to keep me on the road meeting voters, to make critical early investments in ads and outreach, and to build our network of supporters and volunteers.
They’re also a show of our campaign’s strength! I’m a first-time candidate running against men with long years of experience politicking, campaigning, and fundraising — and frankly, some folks are already counting me out.
It’s important we hit our first goal and show our grassroots support to prove we’re in this race to win. If you’re able, please chip in before tonight’s 11:59 PM deadline to hit our January donation goal. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tmnj-em-q12024]
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $10 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tmnj-em-q12024?express_lane=true&amount=10]

Kirsten just announced she’s one of the first members of the Democratic National Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue program for 2024!
Here’s what it means: our race is one of the most competitive in the whole country. In November, we can get a Republican out of office and elect a Democrat who will fight for the issues that matter most.
Kirsten is an advocate for abortion rights, the environment, and veterans. Juan Ciscomani, her opponent, is an advocate for Donald Trump and Mike Johnson.
We can flip Arizona’s Sixth Congressional District blue — but we’ll need your help. Can you split a donation between Kirsten and Ruben Gallego before our fundraising deadline in 2 days?

In 2022, we lost by one percentage point.
With a margin that thin, every bit of support makes a difference.

Kirsten Engel is a mom, an environmental attorney, and a former State Legislator who has fought for years to restore funding to public schools, protect Arizona's natural resources, and make our communities safer. She’s ready to take that fight to Washington to find common-sense solutions to the challenges we’re facing here in Arizona's Sixth Congressional District.

=========================================Friend, my story starts with my mom. She raised me on her own, sometimes working two jobs to make ends meet. As a public school teacher, she taught me to value education; although I excelled in sports, homework always came first in our house. 
A lot of the policies I'm fighting for now – affordable child care, universal pre-k, more support and opportunities for our kids – are informed by the tough choices I watched her make while I was growing up.
My world was small growing up. I don't remember traveling much farther than Brownsville, where my grandparents lived. But my love of reading and the strong community I found at our local YMCA made it feel bigger. I had a lot of support along the way to earn a full football scholarship to Baylor and eventually make it to the NFL – I think that's what makes me so committed to fighting for today's kids. I don't want my story to be the exception; I want every kid to be supported and empowered to succeed.
My wife, Aly, and our two boys inspire me to work harder and dream bigger every day. When we decided to have kids, I knew from day one that I wanted to be there for every moment, and I wanted us to be equal partners. That's a big part of what inspired me to become the first member of Congress to take paternity leave and make fighting for paid family leave a key priority. 
I'm telling you all this because it's all a big part of why I'm running for Senate – to fight for families like yours and mine. And, yes, as a fourth-generation Texan, I'm also sick and tired of watching Ted Cruz trample over our rights and embarrass the Lone Star State every chance he gets. Friend, I know Texans are ready for change, and I've taken down guys a lot tougher than Ted Cruz before. But I need your help.
Experts are calling Texas a battleground state, saying this could be one of the most competitive and most expensive races this cycle. It's going to take a historic outpouring of grassroots support to beat Ted Cruz, and I don't want to risk losing because we didn't have the resources we needed. So I'm personally asking, will you chip in $5 today to help me defeat Ted Cruz and be the senator Texas families deserve? Any amount you can spare is truly appreciated →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!

Jenga, far-right extremists like Jim Jordan and Rick Scott have been scheming for years to cut Social Security and other lifesaving programs like Medicare. In 2023, President Biden destroyed their hopes of passing cuts through Congress — but this fight is far from over.
Now, the Supreme Court has heard arguments on a case that could DOOM Social Security, Medicare, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and so many other programs that American families rely on. 
Experts are warning that the Supreme Court's ruling could even "trigger a second Great Depression!"
We need Americans to make their voices heard loud and clear NOW to tell the extremists on the Court that we won't let them destroy these programs that millions of us count on. But our petition is missing 1,295 signatures — including yours! Please, will you add your name before our 11:59 p.m. deadline tonight to protect Social Security from right-wing extremists?

We need Americans to make their voices heard loud and clear NOW to tell the extremists on the Court that we won't let them destroy these programs that millions of us count on. But our petition is missing 1,295 signatures — including yours! Please, will you add your name before our 11:59 p.m. deadline tonight to protect Social Security from right-wing extremists?
ADD MY NAME
A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

   Happy Groundhog Day,
   Jenga!
   To celebrate one of Pennsylvania’s greatest traditions, I have a joke for
   you:
   Did you hear about the groundhog who ran for office? His campaign had a
   great ground game…
   I know it’s corny, but trust me, that groundhog knew his stuff. Getting
   boots on the ground and talking with voters is important, especially in a
   race as competitive as this one.

   Earlier this week, Donald Trump won New Hampshire — essentially putting an end to the primary. 
Republicans are quickly consolidating behind him, so I’m asking you to pitch in to Joe Biden’s campaign to show that we have his back.
Please split a donation today between Joe Biden’s campaign and my reelection. Every dollar will go toward our efforts to hold the White House and Senate.
DONATE: https://act.chrismurphy.com/go/713?t=1001&akid=1806%2E2494310%2E35SgCu
If you’re asking why this matters, I want you to think about all that’s at stake.
I don’t need to rehash the horrors of Trump’s four years in the Oval Office. I’m sure you remember it well. But if he returns, there will be even fewer checks and balances in place.
Trump is fully surrounded by the most extreme parts of the Republican Party. Anybody who cared about norms or institutions is gone. He’s got a hand-picked Supreme Court majority that’s proven they are just right-wing political actors in robe.
He’s going to try to extinguish any hope we have left for democracy. He proved that to all of us on January 6th.
He’s on the campaign trail bragging every day about how insane his agenda is. He wants full credit for overturning Roe v. Wade, and we know he will ban abortion nationwide — overruling even blue states — if he can. After this month’s school shooting in Iowa, he told people they needed to get over it. Donald Trump doesn’t care about the daily carnage of guns in this country because it’s just the price of the gun lobby’s “guns everywhere” agenda.
This is just the tip of the iceberg. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has spent three years delivering as much progress as possible — a gun safety bill, climate action, infrastructure, lower drug prices, and the list goes on. His record is unmatched as the most consequential president of our lifetime. 
I’m all-in on this fight for our democracy and our future. I’m going to do everything I can to reelect Joe, and I am asking you to join me:
Please split a contribution between Joe Biden’s campaign and my reelection right now. It’s important that we have as many people pitching in as possible as we prepare to kickoff the general election.

Look, you know I’m not one for false alarms or doomsday messages. But politics is not a game for me. The stakes are far too real and far too high for all of us in one way or another.
This is the reality in 2024, but we each have the choice to decide what we’re going to do about it. Thank you in advance for pitching in.
Every best wish,
Chris Murphy

=========================================ON THIS DAY IN 2023: Maria’s environmental victory for Bristol Bay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r56Ym3KkNM
WA Sen. Maria Cantwell’s great week highlights Alaska’s identity crisis
For more than 20 years now [Cantwell has] led filibusters or other efforts against oil drilling in ANWR, against old-growth logging in the state’s vast coastal rainforests, and now against the nation’s most enormous mine.
The Seattle Times
E.P.A Bans Disposal of Mine Waste in Bristol Bay
Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, one of the first lawmakers to oppose the project, said she was “ecstatic” about the E.P.A. action.
New York Times
“It might be the knockout punch in a long battle to save fishing jobs in Washington.”
KIRO Radio
EPA may have dealt final ‘nail in the coffin’ to Alaska’s Pebble Mine
“This is the final nail in the coffin for the Pebble Mine,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash). She added the mine “would have devastated Bristol Bay salmon” and the thousands of families that depend on that fishery.
The Washington Post
“No company will ever be able to stick a mine on top of some of the best salmon habitat in the world.”
Senator Maria Cantwell
Keep Maria fighting for our environment!

=========================================My name is Jon Tester.
I'm the Senate's only working dirt farmer. I lost three fingers in a meat grinding accident when I was younger. I get a $12 flattop haircut. Most of my shirts are stained with dirt.
Montana values are in my bones. And I'm sure as hell going to win this race.
But I’ll need your help to overcome the millions of dollars in attacks and win this toss-up race:
If you’re ready to get to work, split a grassroots donation today between my campaign and Colin Allred's to become a 2024 Founding Donor and help us overcome the attacks heading my way:

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

Friend-
I never planned on being a politician - let alone running for the United States Senate.
In case you’re opening one of my emails for the very first time, I’m Eric Hansen: Proud businessman, father, husband, and now candidate for the U.S. Senate.
I believe our country and our state aren’t living up to their full potential, and frankly - I’m pretty angry about it.
* I’m angry that Delaware schools are ranked 48th in the nation.
* I’m angry that Delaware ranks 5th in opioid and fentanyl deaths.
* I’m angry that upon release, 60% of Delaware criminals are back in prison within 3 years. Only one state is worse.
* I’m angry that Delaware is ranked 48th for government integrity, transparency, and accountability.
* I’m angry that politicians in Washington, D.C. care more about their careers than their constituents.
* I’m angry that at every level of governance, our leaders put partisan politics over what’s best for the people.
Enough is enough. I’m running for Senate to do something about it - about all of it.
I see where we could be as a state - and as a country - and it makes me angry to see how often we fall short. Knowing that 9 times out of 10 it’s because of partisan politics and personal egos only makes it worse.
Now, observers and consultants will say a Republican doesn’t have a chance at winning a Senate seat in Delaware. They’ll say Delawareans will never support someone with an “R” after their name. They’ll say sensible Republican candidates don’t exist.
Well, I’m here to prove them wrong.
https://secure.winred.com/hansen-for-senate/0205email
If you’re angry about where we’ve fallen short as a state and as a nation, then I’m asking you to join me. Let’s get angry enough to prove the naysayers wrong and turn Delaware - and America - around.
Are you with me (https://secure.winred.com/hansen-for-senate/0205email) ?
Thank you!

   Jenga, we can’t get these numbers off our mind.
   $18,000,000. That’s how much a super PAC supporting McCormick announced
   they had raised in just a few short months, and we know that any day, they
   can use it to start blanketing the airwaves with ads attacking Bob Casey.
   $1,000,000. That’s how much mega-millionaire David McCormick already gave
   to his own campaign, and we know he’s able to spend even more to try to
   flip PA red.
   $24.07. That’s our average contribution to these emails. When thousands of
   people who want to see Bob stay in the Senate fighting for Pennsylvania’s
   families chip in $10 here and $30 there, we’re able to stand up to the
   GOP.

=========================================Team,
When Donald Trump was president, he:
 * Pulled out of the Paris climate agreement 
* Stacked environmental agencies with fossil fuel lobbyists 
* And even claimed that our planet will “start getting cooler” – despite all scientific evidence stating otherwise 
Now as the presidential election heats up, we’re seeing more headlines like this:
"No more going wobbly in climate fight, Trump supporters Vow" 
- Politico, 1/16/24
Trump’s supporters and former staffers are creating plans to annihilate climate progress, strip away any sort of regulations in place on fossil fuels, and fill his next administration with even more dangerous climate deniers than before.
We have got to re-elect President Biden and create a bulwark against climate denial in the House and Senate.
Democrats will fight climate change and stand up to the fossil fuel industry. Will you chip in today to help send me and my fellow Democrats back to Congress so we can keep up the fight to protect our planet for the next generation?

will you chip in today to help elect Democrats who will stand up to the fossil fuel industry? 
Team,
When Donald Trump was president, he:
Pulled out of the Paris climate agreement 
Stacked environmental agencies with fossil fuel lobbyists 
And even claimed that our planet will “start getting cooler” – despite all scientific evidence stating otherwise 
Now as the presidential election heats up, we’re seeing more headlines like this:
- Politico, 1/16/24 
Trump’s supporters and former staffers are creating plans to annihilate climate progress, strip away any sort of regulations in place on fossil fuels, and fill his next administration with even more dangerous climate deniers than before.
We have got to re-elect President Biden and create a bulwark against climate denial in the House and Senate.
Democrats will fight climate change and stand up to the fossil fuel industry. Will you chip in today to help send me and my fellow Democrats back to Congress so we can keep up the fight to protect our planet for the next generation?
Thank you,
Sheldon Whitehouse

   Here are 3 things you need to know about our race:
    1. A super PAC supporting Bob’s opponent just announced that it raised
       nearly $18 million. This is a record in the year before an election,
       and we know they’ll have tens of millions more by the summer.
    2. Not only that, but this super PAC is reportedly being funded by
       right-wing billionaires. It’s clear that David McCormick has no
       shortage of deep-pocketed friends waiting in the wings to fund his
       operation.
    3. This is all on top of David McCormick’s ability to self-fund his
       campaign. He already wrote his campaign a $1 million check, and we
       know this is just the beginning.
   Jenga, this is shaping up to be the most expensive Senate race
   our Commonwealth has ever seen, so we need to ask: [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/casey-em-20240129-3?recurring=1&refcode=em20240129-3&refcode2=1842_5072169_451Oog&akid=1842%2E5072169%2E451Oog ]Will you chip in

PAID FOR BY BOB CASEY FOR SENATE INC.

=========================================I've represented my community in Congress for nearly 25 years, friend – but my fight for a better future didn't start there.
From working with the local NAACP to desegregate my girls cheerleading squad at San Fernando High School to being the only member of Congress to vote against the Afghanistan war, I've never stopped fighting for what's right.
Now, I'm the only Black woman in the California Senate primary – and if I win this race, I'll take the experience, struggles and voice of Black women to the Senate. But the hard reality is that Black women candidates fundraise just one-third the amount that white women candidates do.
That's why my team and I set an ambitious goal to raise $100,000 before our crucial end-of-month deadline – but with just one day left to hit this goal, we're falling dangerously short.
So please, with this being our FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out, I have to ask: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign?
The challenges our country is facing – from economic injustice to attacks on our reproductive freedom – require bold, progressive solutions. I'm ready to deliver for all people, but I need your help.
With 20% of California voters still undecided, our work to get out the vote has never been more important. That's why my team is focusing on hiring more organizers, door knockers and phone bankers to continue spreading my progressive message across the state.
Listen, there are only 35 days left until the primary election, and I MUST continue to expand my reach until the very last poll closes. That's why I've set a goal to raise $100,000 online before the month ends to help amp up our grassroots operations in key areas across California – and I'm counting on committed team members like you to help. 
So I'm humbly asking, to give my bid for Senate the best possible chance: Will you donate just $5 to my campaign? Now is the time to dig deep so we can turn out as many voters as possible for primary day.

Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Jenga, I wanted to be the first to share some exciting news with you: The very first TV ad of our reelection campaign just went live this morning! 
Click here to watch our brand-new ad about the Dignity of Work – and how I'm fighting every day in the Senate to protect it. >>
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-feb-ad?refcode=tk1218-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
This is such a pivotal moment for our campaign – and it's all thanks to grassroots support from folks like you. Getting our message out to voters across Ohio is how we’re going to defend this critical seat and our Senate majority.
But I'll be honest: Air time is expensive. And while my GOP opponents can write themselves million-dollar checks to try to buy this seat, I’m counting on grassroots support to fight back and keep our ad live.
So that's why I have to ask: Will you chip in $5 or more right now to help keep our brand-new TV ad on the air so we can win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue?

=========================================                          [1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
   The Texas primary is 30 days away, so we’re reaching out to ask you to support Dr. Brian Williams’ campaign for Congress in TX-32.
Brian is an Air Force veteran, trauma surgeon, and a member of the team Murphy family. Just like so many in our movement, the issue of gun violence found him. In 2016, he rose to national attention when he led the team that operated on Dallas police officers who were shot during a peaceful protest against police brutality.
Three died on his watch when they were there trying to protect young people exercising their rights. And it is Brian’s voice, as a Black trauma surgeon, that broke through as a community grieved and tried to make sense of what happened.
In 2022, Chris hired him to join our fight to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He worked tirelessly to help us break the gun lobby’s 30-year grip on Congress, and now he’s taking on his next mission — running for the open-seat in TX-32.
Please split a donation between Dr. Brian Williams’ campaign and our reelection today to help us grow our gun safety movement’s power in Congress.
CONTRIBUTE:https://act.chrismurphy.com/go/714?t=1001&akid=1826%2E2494310%2EWxysir
Brian will bring an important perspective and voice to Congress.
He knows what it is like to have to tell a parent their child won’t survive. He also understands what it’s like to operate on an expecting mother experiencing a deadly pregnancy complication.
He brings a powerful frontline experience, and he will help our movement build power in Washington to end gun violence, restore abortion rights, and deliver real progress for working families.
But he’s going to face his first test at the ballot box in just 30 days. This is an important test of our movement’s strength, so we need to do all we can to make sure he has the resources to win.
If you can, please split a contribution between Dr. Brian Williams and Chris Murphy today. He urgently needs our support in the home stretch, and it would mean a lot to Chris and Brian to know you have their backs.

Jenga , 
I put my entire life on the line for this moment. 
My name is Hung Cao. I served for 25 years in the U.S. Navy reaching the rank 
of Captain because I owe my life to America, and I wanted to pay the freest 
nation on Earth back for all its given me.
But when I returned home after my final tour of duty, I came back to a country 
I hardly recognized.
The very freedoms I fought for were under attack. Joe Biden was practically 
ripping our constitution apart and refusing to enforce the rule of law. Our 
cities were becoming overrun with crime because Democrat politicians were 
choosing thugs over American citizens.
Woke was winning, and the American people were suffering. 
I stepped up for America when our country needed a fighter before, and I knew 
I had to do it again. That’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate. 
<https://secure.winred.com/hung-cao-for-virginia/i-put-my-life-on-the-line>
JOIN THE TEAM 
<https://secure.winred.com/hung-cao-for-virginia/i-put-my-life-on-the-line>
With you on my team, I know we can put an end to the disasters of the Biden 
Administration.
I’m not a career politician. Unlike the Left, power and prestige mean little 
to me.
 I’m here to get the job done for Virginia and for America, and I want YOU on 
my team to help me do it.
Will you join me today to fix the Biden administration’s failures, take back 
the Senate, and SAVE America?

Hung knows the American Dream is worth saving - because he’s lived it. Now, 
he’s running for Senate to defend it from the next generation. Hung Cao came to 
America with little besides the clothes on his back, and after his 25-year

Jenga ,   I put my entire life on the line for this moment. My name is Hung Cao. I served for 25 years in the U.S. Navy reaching the rank of Captain because I owe my life to America, and I wanted to pay the freest nation on Earth back for all its given me. But when I returned home after my final tour of duty, I came back to a country I hardly recognized.  The very freedoms I fought for were under attack. Joe Biden was practically ripping our constitution apart and refusing to enforce the rule of law. Our cities were becoming overrun with crime because Democrat politicians were choosing thugs over American citizens. Woke was winning, and the American people were suffering.  I stepped up for America when our country needed a fighter before, and I knew I had to do it again. That’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate.   JOIN THE TEAMWith you on my team, I know we can put an end to the disasters of the Biden Administration.I’m not a career politician. Unlike the Left, power and prestige mean little to me. I’m here to get the job done for Virginia and for America, and I want YOU on my team to help me do it. Will you join me today to fix the Biden administration’s failures, take back the Senate, and SAVE America?  JOIN THE TEAMIn Liberty,   CAPT Hung Cao USN (Ret)  TEXT HUNG TO 21412Hung knows the American Dream is worth saving - because he’s lived it. Now, he’s running for Senate to defend it from the next generation.

Friend —
I wanted to reach out today and tell you a little bit about how I got my start in politics.
Then, if you’re able, I hope you’ll make a contribution to my re-election campaign to help me keep up my fight for Maine people in the Senate. [https://donate.angusformaine.com/a/ask-em-jan24?]
Long story short: Think of a yardstick. Let me explain...
My very first job out of law school brought me to Skowhegan, a small town of less than 8,000 residents back then. I worked for Pine Tree Legal Assistance, helping provide free legal aid for low-income people.
Not long into my time there, I realized just how many challenges the families I helped faced. It seemed like people would come into my office with three feet of problems, but the legal aid I provided could solve only about five inches of the issues my clients struggled with.
On top of that, these families were worried about everything from education to health care to transportation — all challenges that come with living in poverty.
I wanted a way I could help people solve issues that were on the whole yardstick, not just the few inches I could deal with as a lawyer.
Then, when Maine voters elected me to my first term as governor in 1994, I finally got my chance. I dedicated all my effort to creating jobs, reigniting Maine’s economy, reforming our state mental health services, pursuing common-sense environmental protections, and more.
Now in my role as senator, I can do even more to help people in Maine and across the country tackle the issues further up their yardstick. I’ve committed myself to working to improve the prospects for all Maine people, protect our national security interests, build a stronger democracy, and safeguard our environment for future generations.
It’s the most important job of my career, and I’d be honored to continue my work building bipartisan consensus for the challenges facing our nation — but I can’t do it without you, friend.
So if you’re able, can you chip in a donation of $10 or any amount to support my re-election campaign? I’m here on behalf of people like you, and I promise to continue to work hard for you in the days and weeks ahead. [https://donate.angusformaine.com/a/ask-em-jan24?]

   Young lady, Wells Fargo does not make mistakes.
   Those were the words I heard in late 2007 after presenting my research
   showing 70% of lenders were trying to collect more money than homeowners
   believed they owed.
   Back up for a second: In 2007 I was a law professor researching whether
   banks were taking advantage of homeowners by claiming Americans owed more
   than they really did. In a sample of 1,700 cases, I found banks were
   asking people to pay $6 million more than they expected. Banks repeatedly
   didn’t have the documentation to back up their claims, and nobody in the
   system was willing or able to stop them. For so many families that meant
   losing their home entirely.
   It was a Wells Fargo lawyer who stood up after I presented my findings at
   a conference and lectured me on how the vast teams at Wells Fargo could
   afford to follow the law, and plenty of other Big Bank lawyers chimed in.
   The conventional wisdom was that banks were always right, and nobody
   needed to question it.
   If banks don’t make mistakes, the next logical conclusion was that this
   was in fact a deliberate strategy to break the rules and cheat borrowers.
   Because of this research, a few months later I was asked to testify before
   the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.
   Senator Chuck Schumer came prepared with a poster board, and pointed out
   how Wall Street boasted their strategy of foreclosure and late fees helped
   them become even more profitable. I left that hearing thinking punishment
   was coming for those lawbreaking banks, but for the most part they
   continued to collect every penny without following every rule.
   As a professor, I could study and point out problems. But I wanted to do
   more to actually change our system. I’m running for the U.S. Senate to
   fight for the people who have been taken advantage of by big corporations
   and are struggling to get ahead.
   That’s the work I’ve always done, and with your support I can head back to
   the Senate—this time with the power to hold Wall Street to account. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240129-1?refcode=em20240129-37091&refcode2=37091_10298894_b1VFWW&akid=37091%2E10298894%2Eb1VFWW ]I'd

This is a make-or-break moment – and the race couldn’t be closer! If National Republicans win this Special Election in 8 days, they’ll get off scot-free for protecting Santos for months.

For over a year, the American people have faced chaos, crisis and confusion caused by extreme Republicans. Team Extreme spent months protecting serial fraudster George Santos. Now we have a real shot at bringing actual representation to New York’s 3rd Congressional District by electing Tom on February 13.
Team, we’re just 8 days away from the special election and although this is our first big test of 2024, our work doesn’t stop there. We’re off to the races all across the country building the groundwork to take back the House majority.
Will you stand with me and show the nation that we are ready to defeat extremism once and for all in November by splitting a donation right now between Tom Suozzi and Lisa Blunt Rochester? >> [http://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_suozzi?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.02.05_B1_JeffriesSuozzi-split_30op&amount=25]

Look: I’m about to ask you to donate $25 to help Democrats win the Special Election to replace serial fraudster George Santos by splitting a donation between Tom Suozzi and Lisa Blunt Rochester. This is a make-or-break moment – and the race couldn’t be closer! If National Republicans win this Special Election in 8 days, they’ll get off scot-free for protecting Santos for months. We cannot let that happen. Please, folks: Will you rush $25 to help us win this special election, have a record fundraising day and build a foundation to reclaim the House? >> 
For over a year, the American people have faced chaos, crisis and confusion caused by extreme Republicans. Team Extreme spent months protecting serial fraudster George Santos. Now we have a real shot at bringing actual representation to New York’s 3rd Congressional District by electing Tom on February 13.
Team, we’re just 8 days away from the special election and although this is our first big test of 2024, our work doesn’t stop there. We’re off to the races all across the country building the groundwork to take back the House majority.
Will you stand with me and show the nation that we are ready to defeat extremism once and for all in November by splitting a donation right now between Tom Suozzi and Lisa Blunt Rochester? >>
We only need to win five more seats to take back The People’s House and helping Tom in NY-03’s special election can get us one closer. I’m counting on your support.
We can’t do this without you. Can you chip in right now with a split donation between Tom Suozzi and Lisa Blunt Rochester? >>

=========================================2.6%. That's the incredibly slim margin Ted Cruz won by in 2018.
2%. That's how much a new poll shows we're trailing by now, with 11% of voters still undecided.
$2. That's what we're asking you to donate ahead of our critical end-of-month deadline to help us reach those undecided voters and take the lead.
So how about it, friend? Can Colin count on you to chip in $2 (or any amount!) to help him fire Ted Cruz this November and help Democrats protect the Senate? →

We've made incredible progress, so far, friend. Thanks to more than 200,000 fired-up grassroots supporters like you, we've cut Ted's lead from 5 points to 2, and this race is already closer than the margin Ted won by in 2018. 
Now, we've got just over 9 months to reach undecided voters, take the lead, and FINALLY send Ted Cruz packing. To do that, we need to have the biggest voter outreach and mobilization program Texas has ever seen, and we need to hit our $500,000 end-of-month goal by midnight tomorrow to put our plans into action.
So we're respectfully asking: Please, friend, will you chip in $2 or more to keep our momentum going and make sure Colin has the resources he needs to beat Ted Cruz? Every dollar makes a difference to our grassroots campaign! →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================I had to share this update immediately, friend: 
FIRST: CNN analysts named me one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot, and experts said that Nevada could once again decide Senate control.
THEN: Mitch McConnell recruited a far-right candidate to jump into this race and defeat me – and he just set a new GOP fundraising record.
NOW: Polling shows us neck and neck. This isn't good.
Friend, I can't fight back and protect this seat without the critical grassroots support of folks like you. But time is running out before our midnight deadline, and we're still way short of our $50,000 goal.
That's why I'm humbly asking: Please, will you give $5 or more right now to help me reach this goal, keep Nevada blue, and defend the Senate for Democrats?

I had to share this update immediately, friend: 
FIRST: CNN analysts named me one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot, and experts said that Nevada could once again decide Senate control.
THEN: Mitch McConnell recruited a far-right candidate to jump into this race and defeat me – and he just set a new GOP fundraising record.
NOW: Polling shows us neck and neck. This isn't good.
Friend, I can't fight back and protect this seat without the critical grassroots support of folks like you. But time is running out before our midnight deadline, and we're way short of our $50,000 goal.
That's why I'm humbly asking: Please, will you give $5 or more right now to help me reach this goal, keep Nevada blue, and defend the Senate for Democrats?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $5
Donate $25
Donate $50
Donate another amount
I'm so grateful to have you by my side in this fight to keep Nevada and the Senate blue. Together, I know we can win this.
									Thank you,
									Jacky Rosen
A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

=========================================Friend, tomorrow is the start of early voting, and now, more than ever, every moment matters.
We have an unprecedented chance to reshape California's future for working people – and all we have to do is reach enough voters across California with our message of progress. But California is massive, which means the voter outreach gets expensive.
I'm counting on grassroots supporters like you to pull it off, so please: Will you chip in $5 to help me reach voters in every corner of California so that I can pull ahead in this race? We're entering the final stretch, and there isn't a second to waste.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode=jtk1022-fr-text
I talk a lot about how I've spent my career fighting for social justice and equality – like when I was the lone vote against giving President Bush unlimited war powers or how I've worked tirelessly to take action on the climate crisis. 
These aren't just talking points, friend – these are the principles that have always guided my work, and will continue to guide my work as I fight for marginalized and working people in the Senate. 
But I need your help to get there – so, with early voting starting tomorrow,  will you pitch in to help fuel my campaign? Together, we can build a progressive future for California.

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Jenga, it's Kirsten. I'm about to ask you to make a $5 donation ahead of my end-of-month deadline at midnight tonight. This is an incredibly important deadline, and I'm counting on your help to hit my goal. But first, I want to thank you — so much — for supporting my campaign.
I'm fighting every single day to earn your support and deliver on the promises I've made to you. From certifying the Equal Rights Amendment so that we can restore reproductive rights nationwide to fighting gun violence and keeping our communities safe, I'm working tirelessly to win change for your family.
As my grandmother taught me when I was a young girl, politics isn't about parties or polling numbers. It's about the people. It's my job to serve your family and do everything that I can to make life better for you. And it's an honor that I'm grateful for every day. So thank you for trusting me with your support and giving me this incredible opportunity to serve.
I wish that I could end this email here. But unfortunately, elections are an unavoidable part of politics. And to continue to serve your family in the Senate and win progress on all the issues you care about — reproductive rights, affordable health care, protecting our seniors and so much more — I need your help.
Democrats are heading into a historically difficult election cycle. And here in New York, right-wing extremists just had their best election in decades in 2022. I'm confident that we can reverse that trend in 2024. But because I refuse to accept money from corporate PACs, I'm counting on grassroots donations to compete with far-right megadonors. 
Please, if I've earned your support and trust fighting for you in the Senate, will you make a donation to help me continue this work and defend my seat? I'm up against a critical deadline tonight, and I need a surge in grassroots support now to hit my goal.

Democrats are heading into a historically difficult election cycle. And here in New York, right-wing extremists just had their best election in decades in 2022. I'm confident that we can reverse that trend in 2024. But because I refuse to accept money from corporate PACs, I'm counting on grassroots donations to compete with far-right megadonors. 
Please, if I've earned your support and trust fighting for you in the Senate, will you make a donation to help me continue this work and defend my seat? I'm up against a critical deadline tonight, and I need a surge in grassroots support now to hit my goal.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $5
DONATE $25
DONATE $50
DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT
Thank you for trusting me to fight for your family. It is the highest honor.
									With gratitude and love,
									Kirsten
A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

ENDORSEMENT STATUS: *## PENDING ##*
DEADLINE: *11:59 P.M.*
Friend, here are three critical things you need to know about Colin's fight
to flip Ted Cruz's seat blue:
1️⃣ The same day that Colin launched his bid, this team raised more than
Ted Cruz did in *the first 3 months of the year *– smashing Texas records!
2️⃣ After winning by just 2.6% in 2018, Ted Cruz is more vulnerable than
ever – and now, BOTH Roll Call and Inside Elections *have officially
reevaluated this race from "Solid Republican" to "Battleground!"*
3️⃣ According to experts at FiveThirtyEight, Texas could be Democrats' best
chance to flip a red seat in 2024 – *and that's why Team Allred is ready to
go all in to make it happen.*
*But Colin's running a 100% people-powered movement, friend – that means he
needs every single grassroots member to urgently declare their support. **So
please, before midnight tonight, will you be one of the 24,000 supporters
we need to endorse Colin's campaign and win in 2024? →

Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real
leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots
movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to
“Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are
predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas,
defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

** your OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT PENDING **
Colin Allred is the Democrats' best chance to defeat Ted Cruz and win in Texas for the first time in decades – but only if at least 24,000 more grassroots supporters like you stand with him by midnight tonight.
Will you add your name now to endorse his run for Senate?
ENDORSE COLIN ALLRED →
TEAM ALLRED | OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT RECORD
SUPPORTER ID: Jengabuiling90@gmail.com
ENDORSEMENT STATUS: ## PENDING ##
DEADLINE: 11:59 P.M.
Friend, here are three critical things you need to know about Colin's fight to flip Ted Cruz's seat blue:
1️⃣ The same day that Colin launched his bid, this team raised more than Ted Cruz did in the first 3 months of the year – smashing Texas records!
2️⃣ After winning by just 2.6% in 2018, Ted Cruz is more vulnerable than ever – and now, BOTH Roll Call and Inside Elections have officially reevaluated this race from "Solid Republican" to "Battleground!"
3️⃣ According to experts at FiveThirtyEight, Texas could be Democrats' best chance to flip a red seat in 2024 – and that's why Team Allred is ready to go all in to make it happen.
But Colin's running a 100% people-powered movement, friend – that means he needs every single grassroots member to urgently declare their support. So please, before midnight tonight, will you be one of the 24,000 supporters we need to endorse Colin's campaign and win in 2024? →
ENDORSE COLIN ALLRED →
None of this is possible without you – thank you.
									Team Allred
						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================                         [1]Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate
   “Supporting Josh Hawley was… the worst decision I’ve ever made in my
                                     life.”
   Jenga — that’s
   a real quote from Josh Hawley’s former mentor, Missouri’s three-term GOP
   U.S. Senator Jack Danforth. Here’s what happened:
                          [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43296?refcode=em20240203-4740&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4740%2E1040133%2EBetv2V Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN →
   FIRST — In 2018, former Missouri Senator Jack Danforth recruited Josh
   Hawley to run for U.S. Senate. Danforth even cleared the crowded field of
   Republican challengers in Hawley’s primary.
   THEN — On January 6, 2021, Josh Hawley showed the world that he’s a coward
   and a fraud by raising his fist then running for his life at the U.S.
   Capitol.
   NOW — Danforth and a handful of Hawley’s other mentors + mega-donors are
   refusing to support his re-election campaign — and recent reports from
   Morning Consult found Hawley’s approvals plummeting among Missouri voters.
   Republicans and Democrats across Missouri agree: We can’t afford another
   six years of Josh Hawley representing us in the U.S. Senate.
                          [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43296?refcode=em20240203-4740&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4740%2E1040133%2EBetv2V Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]DEFEAT HAWLEY: CHIP IN →
   Now here’s why we need your help,
   Jenga:
   Every dollar we raise gives us an opportunity to keep exposing Hawley as a
   fraud and a coward — and allows us to reach voters with Lucas’
   election-winning message every day between now and November 5.
   That’s what it’ll take to win this race. So now we’re asking you:

   can get Lucas’ message in front of Missouri voters and continue to hold
   Josh Hawley accountable for embarrassing our state and betraying our
   country? Lucas doesn’t take a cent from corporate PACs, so your support
   today really will make a big impact on our grassroots campaign.

Can you chip in $10 or just whatever you can today so we can get Lucas’ message in front of Missouri voters and continue to hold Josh Hawley accountable for embarrassing our state and betraying our country? Lucas doesn’t take a cent from corporate PACs, so your support today really will make a big impact on our grassroots campaign.

51 years after Roe v. Wade first protected women’s right to choose, it is becoming more and more dangerous to be pregnant in our country.
Too many headlines tell us how the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs has allowed pregnant women to be prosecuted for seeking abortion care and enabled states like Idaho to pass extreme abortion bans that make no exception even more medical emergencies.
The only way to protect every single American is to flip the House, expand our majority in the Senate, and reelect President Biden to make the right to an abortion federally protected. Will you donate $10 before January 31 to help stop these abortion bans? [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc-fr-2312?amount=10]
Ever since the Dobbs decision overturned decades of precedent, voters have made it abundantly clear that they don’t support abortion bans.
This is a losing issue for Republicans, and they know it. But that won’t stop them from seeking a federal ban on abortion if they win full control of Congress.

=========================================The deadline is fast approaching.     Dear Virginia Patriots, Ron Paul knows Jonathan well. He has endorsed him for the U.S. Senate. Jonathan wrote bills for Congressman Ron Paul, including the predecessor to the Right to Try Act signed into law by President Trump. That predecessor bill, the Access to Medical Treatment Act, was introduced again and again by Ron Paul and was blocked every session of Congress by the drug lobby. Then Rand Paul introduced an updated version of the bill Jonathan originally wrote, and this time, with the backing of President Trump, the bill became law. The Right to Try Act saved countless lives by removing FDA from blocking terminally ill patients from having access to experimental treatments. That is but one of Jonathan’s many accomplishments that have saved American lives and liberty. A renowned constitutional litigator and scholar, Jonathan holds the record or defeating FDA censorship in court, eight times, earning him the name “FDA Dragon Slayer.” He is one of the few attorneys in American history to defeat the federal bureaucracy repeatedly, gaining him great respect from his colleagues and an AV rating (highest in legal ability and ethics) from the Martindale Hubbell law rating organization. Jonathan’s victories have saved countless lives, including those of the unborn. Jonathan seems destined for his role to restore our republic and uphold the Constitution against those who would replace it with a communist dictatorship.

=========================================Friend, I would not be where I am today without the remarkable heroes in my life who have opened doors for me.
In many ways, February is not just a time to think about what lies ahead in our continued fight for progress, but also to pause and reflect on the significant contributions and sacrifices of our great African American ancestors and elders who dedicated and often sacrificed their lives to the fight for equity, civil rights, and social and economic justice.
That’s why in honor of Black History Month, I’ve put together a short photo album to celebrate those who have inspired me in my life – from my mentor Shirley Chisholm to my mother Mildred Massey and my dear friend John Lewis. 
Will you take a minute now to scroll through my Black History Month Heroes Album? I wouldn't be where I am today without the great leaders and trailblazers before me, so allow me just a moment of your time to share their stories.
http://surveys.signforgood.com/lee-2024-bhm-heroes-album?code=jtk1008-su-text&amp;email=Jengabuiling90@gmail.com&zip=02120&ask=5&amounts=5,25,50,100
I hope that in the days ahead, you join me in continuing the important work of uplifting the Black community, and dedicating ourselves as a nation to overcoming the systemic and institutional challenges that continue to affect African Americans – but for now, I hope you enjoy my photo album.

=========================================   Friend, 
We send a lot of emails your way, and we appreciate you going through your inbox and opening this one. 
And we know you can’t donate to every email we send — not by a long shot. But we’re hoping you might chip in to this one. 
If you’ve got a minute, please let us explain why:
FIRST: Another Arizona poll was released last week showing Ruben trailing Kari Lake by a couple points. We have to turn these polls around. FAST. 
THEN: Kari Lake held a fundraiser with two wealthy QAnon activists on Friday — a dangerous and violent anti-government conspiracy theory at the heart of the MAGA-right. 
NOW: We’re expecting Kyrsten Sinema to decide whether or not to run for re-election any day — and we need to ramp up our fundraising to be ready for whatever she decides. 
Arizona is the seat Democrats need to win to hold the Senate. And the fate of the Senate depends on how strong our fundraising is. If everyone reading this chipped in $5 or $10 Ruben would have everything he needs to win this race. 
But not everyone chips in. That’s why we need you. We need people who know how important this Senate race is, people who understand how important their donations are to our campaign to chip in what they can, when they can. 
Can we count on you? 
Use this link and contribute $5, $10, whatever you can to help Ruben win in Arizona and defend our Senate majority. With hundreds of people chipping in alongside you, it’s going to add up fast. 
Contribute: https://act.gallegoforarizona.com/go/2379?t=1001&akid=1929%2E6821758%2EPm5vWr

Friend,
We send a lot of emails your way, and we appreciate you going through your inbox and opening this one. 
And we know you can’t donate to every email we send — not by a long shot. But we’re hoping you might chip in to this one. 
If you’ve got a minute, please let us explain why:
FIRST: Another Arizona poll was released last week showing Ruben trailing Kari Lake by a couple points. We have to turn these polls around. FAST. 
THEN: Kari Lake held a fundraiser with two wealthy QAnon activists on Friday — a dangerous and violent anti-government conspiracy theory at the heart of the MAGA-right. 
NOW: We’re expecting Kyrsten Sinema to decide whether or not to run for re-election any day — and we need to ramp up our fundraising to be ready for whatever she decides. 
Arizona is the seat Democrats need to win to hold the Senate. And the fate of the Senate depends on how strong our fundraising is. If everyone reading this chipped in $5 or $10 Ruben would have everything he needs to win this race.
But not everyone chips in. That’s why we need you. We need people who know how important this Senate race is, people who understand how important their donations are to our campaign to chip in what they can, when they can. 
Can we count on you? 
Use this link and contribute $5, $10, whatever you can to help Ruben win in Arizona and defend our Senate majority. With hundreds of people chipping in alongside you, it’s going to add up fast. 
If you've stored your info with ActBlue, we'll process your contribution instantly.

=========================================Team,
Election Day is going to be here before we know it, and the stakes couldn’t be higher for the fight to defend and expand our Senate majority. Special interests are already hard at work barraging Democrats, and the country will take a big step backward if Republicans are able to ride a wave of dark money to recapture the Senate.
It’s crunch time, team, but we know full well we can’t defend and expand our Democratic Senate majority unless committed supporters like you join this fight.
Will you make a $5 contribution to keep Rhode Island blue and protect our Democratic Senate majority this November? 
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/whitehouse_email?refcode=jtk731-ot-welcome&amount=5
It’s an honor to fight for Rhode Islanders every single day, and we’ve seen what a Democratic majority in the Senate can do.
We passed the American Rescue Plan and our job-creating bipartisan infrastructure bill to support working families and small businesses. We passed a law guaranteeing every American the freedom to marry the one they love. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, lowering costs for families and investing in a clean energy future. And my bill to restore the integrity of the Supreme Court passed out of committee and has momentum.
There is a lot more to do. We have a razor-thin majority in the Senate and we’re on defense in a lot of states. But if Democrats can hold on, we can continue to take on big polluters and pass meaningful legislation to combat climate change. We can make high-quality health care more affordable and accessible. We can clean up our politics and get anonymous, unlimited special interest money out of Congress and away from the Supreme Court.
If we lose our Senate majority, however, Republicans will allow every move Congress makes to be decided by the ultra-wealthy and the big corporate special interests that funded their campaigns.
Can I count on you to join me today in the fight to defend and expand our Senate majority? Donate what you can now >> https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/whitehouse_email?refcode=jtk731-ot-welcome
Thank you again for joining this team,
Sheldon Whitehouse

Team,
Election Day is going to be here before we know it, and the stakes couldn’t be higher for the fight to defend and expand our Senate majority. Special interests are already hard at work barraging Democrats, and the country will take a big step backward if Republicans are able to ride a wave of dark money to recapture the Senate.
It’s crunch time, team, but we know full well we can’t defend and expand our Democratic Senate majority unless committed supporters like you join this fight.
Will you make a $5 contribution to keep Rhode Island blue and protect our Democratic Senate majority this November?
It’s an honor to fight for Rhode Islanders every single day, and we’ve seen what a Democratic majority in the Senate can do.
We passed the American Rescue Plan and our job-creating bipartisan infrastructure bill to support working families and small businesses. We passed a law guaranteeing every American the freedom to marry the one they love. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, lowering costs for families and investing in a clean energy future. And my bill to restore the integrity of the Supreme Court passed out of committee and has momentum.
There is a lot more to do. We have a razor-thin majority in the Senate and we’re on defense in a lot of states. But if Democrats can hold on, we can continue to take on big polluters and pass meaningful legislation to combat climate change. We can make high-quality health care more affordable and accessible. We can clean up our politics and get anonymous, unlimited special interest money out of Congress and away from the Supreme Court.
If we lose our Senate majority, however, Republicans will allow every move Congress makes to be decided by the ultra-wealthy and the big corporate special interests that funded their campaigns.
Can I count on you to join me today in the fight to defend and expand our Senate majority? Donate what you can now >>
Thank you again for joining this team,
Sheldon Whitehouse

   Hey Jenga,
   happy Friday!

   Josh Hawley and flip Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat, meaning he’s not taking
   any cues from shady mega-donors or corporate elites. He’s relying on input
   from real people like you to guide the priorities and strategy of our
   campaign at every step of the way.
   So now that it’s officially 2024, we wanted to give Lucas’ top supporters

   Lucas about the issues that matter most to you + your loved ones, feedback
   on the movement we’re building together, and any suggestions you have for
   our campaign moving forward.

=========================================                          [1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
   Five bucks. 
That’s the contribution Chris Murphy is asking you to make today.
Chris is up for reelection this November, and it’s going to take a significant grassroots effort to win this race and hold our Senate majority.
A lot of people ask if $5 makes a real difference when Senate races are so outrageously expensive. Does $5 really make an impact when corporate interests can spend limitless sums? 
The answer is yes. $5 at a time is how we power this movement. It adds up quickly when all of us are chipping in. 
So we’re asking:  If you believe we need Chris’ leadership in the Senate, please pitch in $5 today. Every dollar will be put to work in a way that makes you proud and helps our movement make meaningful change.

=========================================Hey there, Jenga. It's Stefanie, Kirsten's Finance Director. I'll keep this brief.
Unfortunately, last night, we fell just $1,794 short of our weekly grassroots goal. Because Kirsten doesn't accept money from corporate PACs, these weekly goals are one of our most important fundraising benchmarks.
If we don't make up the difference ASAP, we'll never have any chance of hitting our mid-February goal in just a couple of weeks. So please, if you've got a little bit to spare tonight, will you make a donation to help defend Kirsten's must-win seat?
Here's the best link to give: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk4784-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Kirsten is relying on Democrats like you to stand with her against the GOP's megadonors, Jenga. I hope she can count on you today.

Kirsten is working tirelessly to win progress on the issues that matter most to families. She's fighting to pass guaranteed paid family leave, certify the Equal Rights Amendment, lower the cost of living for working families and defend Social Security and Medicare.
If we lose in New York, our Senate majority will be all but DOOMED. But Kirsten refuses to accept a single cent from corporate PACs. That means she cannot afford to miss key weekly grassroots goals like this one. So please, will you rush $5 or more before midnight tonight to make sure that Kirsten has all the resources she needs to defend her must-win seat and defeat GOP extremists?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Hi there,
I want to take a moment to introduce myself — I’m Angus King, the Independent Senator from the great state of Maine.
Nothing is more important to me than doing right by the people of Maine. Throughout my career as an attorney in Skowhegan, Governor, and now as U.S. Senator, my priority has always been on making things work and solving problems for families across our state and country.
As an Independent, I’m focused on building bipartisan consensus around the challenges facing the nation. Together, we’ve made progress in improving the economic prospects of everyday Maine people, safeguarding our national security interests, and advocating for a stronger and healthier country and environment. Still, there is much more work to be done.
In a time when our nation is increasingly divided and new challenges arise daily, we’re going to need to put in a lot of work to ensure we create a future for our children and grandchildren that will be safer, fairer, and more prosperous.

In recent years, Congress has seen the passage of a number of significant bipartisan successes. From the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the CHIPS and Science Act to bolster the American economy, to the PACT Act that expanded veterans' health care and benefits, I fought to turn these bills into laws that actually help working people and families.
As an Independent, I take pride in finding common ground with my colleagues in Congress, ensuring we move beyond arguments and political theater.
I’m not in this fight for personal gain, media attention, or headlines. I’m in the Senate because, at the end of the day, I have seven grandchildren, and I’m working to help create a better future for them and the generations that come after.
It’s not easy being an independent voice in Washington: it means having to work even harder to grow this grassroots team, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
And I’d be honored to have you in this fight with us. Please, add your name to join our grassroots team, and together, we can cut through the political noise and partisan discord to build a better country for future generations. [https://donate.angusformaine.com/f4HEbxAbzEiIO5PMzRvYKQ2]

=========================================This isn't looking good, friend. We just heard from our finance director, Lauren, and donations have slowed dramatically just as we're approaching our critical end-of-month deadline!

We'll be honest: January has been pretty bad for fundraising, and in a race this close, we can't afford to fall short.  At the end of this month, we'll be budgeting our campaign expenses through Election Day in November – and if we fall short of our $500,000 goal, we'll have to scale back our campaign significantly.
We can't let that happen. That's why it's essential that we raise another $107,291 by our end-of-month deadline TONIGHT. Please: Will you rush $5 right now to help us beat this January slump and help Colin defeat Ted Cruz? →

A new poll from earlier this month shows Colin Allred and Ted Cruz in a dead heat, and Cruz won his last election by only 2.6% – which means that, if this team hits its numbers, we can send him packing.
But unlike Ted Cruz, Colin isn't counting on wealthy donors and special-interest allies to buy this election for him. Instead, he's counting on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign every step of the way through Election Day.
Friend, please: Don't let Ted Cruz catch us falling behind. Can you give $5 right now to help us reach our $500,000 end-of-month goal and take down Ted Cruz? →

   The truth is, if you ask most Americans – Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, conservatives – they will agree: we are getting ripped off, big time, by the pharmaceutical industry. Please read my latest op-ed in on the issue below:
-----
Big Pharma will have to answer to the American people
One of my top priorities is to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America
By Sen. Bernie Sanders
It is no great secret that millions of Americans feel that Congress is more interested in protecting large corporations than looking out for ordinary people.
That is never clearer than when we talk about our broken health care system, and the outrageous price of prescription drugs in this country.
The truth is, if you ask most Americans – Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, conservatives – they will agree: we are getting ripped off, big time, by the pharmaceutical industry.
As a nation, we spend almost twice as much per capita as any other country on health care – over $13,000 for every man, woman and child. Even for those with insurance, costs are so high that medical bills are often the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States.
And one of the major reasons for the high cost of health care in America is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
You tell me: why does Merck charge diabetes patients in the United States $6,900 for Januvia when the exact same product can be purchased in Canada for $900 and just $200 in France?
Why does Johnson & Johnson charge Americans with arthritis $79,000 for Stelara when it can be purchased for just $16,000 in the United Kingdom? And why does Bristol Myers Squibb charge patients in our country $7,100 for Eliquis when the same product can be purchased for just $900 in Canada and just $650 in France?
On and on it goes. Almost every prescription drug costs far more in the United States than it does in other countries.
The good news is that we are beginning to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare, for the first time ever, is negotiating the price of some drugs, including Januvia, Stelara and Eliquis.
The bad news is that the pharmaceutical industry is doing everything it can to stop these negotiations, and prevent Congress from making prescription drugs affordable for all Americans – not just those on Medicare.
The giant pharmaceutical and health insurance lobbies have spent huge amounts of money over the past decades to ensure that their profits come before the health of the American people.
Over the past 25 years, the drug companies have spent $8.5 billion on lobbying. Today, they have some 1,800 well-paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C. – including former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties. Unbelievably, that is more than three lobbyists for every member of Congress.
During that same period, they have provided over $700 million in campaign contributions. And they are equal opportunity contributors. They contribute heavily to both Republican and Democratic candidates.
The result of congressional inaction is that these large corporations have driven up the prices of prescription drugs to the point that one out of four Americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe.
Meanwhile, while millions of Americans suffer – and some die – because they can’t afford the prescription drugs they need, 10 of the top pharmaceutical companies in the country made over $110 billion in profits in 2022 and paid their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages.
As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), one of my top priorities is to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America. One of the ways to do that is to hold the chief executives of some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in our country accountable for their actions.
That is why I have invited Robert Davis, the CEO of Merck; Joaquin Duato, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson; and Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb, to a hearing to discuss what they are doing to lower drug prices in America.
Why did we ask these CEOs to come before us? Because the American people deserve answers to some pretty simple questions.
For example: Why is it that the median price of new prescription drugs in America is now over $220,000 – including many new cancer drugs? How does it happen that while millions of Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, when major drug companies in America spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than they do on research and development?
Why is there an enormous lack of transparency in how your companies set drug prices?
These very straightforward questions are on the minds of millions of Americans. These are questions that the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to answer.
And let’s be clear: these are not struggling companies forced to charge high prices to survive. Believe me, they are not going broke. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made nearly $18 billion in profits, paid its CEO over $27 million in compensation and spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and dividends.
That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit, handed out over $7 billion in dividends to their wealthy stockholders and paid its CEO over $52 million in compensation.
And Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits last year, while recently spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and giving its CEO over $41 million in compensation.
I am proud of what the committee has already accomplished.
Last year, the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP Committee hearing that his company would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out of pocket. In a separate HELP Committee hearing last May, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products.
The committee’s efforts are paying off, but much more needs to be done.
I look forward to the hearing on Feb. 8, with the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers Squibb, to discuss how they will substantially lower the price of prescription drugs in America.

   When I say big corporations and their lobbyists have too much power in
   Washington, this is what I mean:
     * Interest groups spent a record $4.2 billion lobbying federal lawmakers
       in 2023 alone. 
     * Health companies outspent every other sector in 2023 with federal
       lobbying spending reaching $739 million for the year.
     * The oil company Chevron—just one company—spent more than $6 million on
       federal lobbying in 2023.
   I’m the only candidate in this race who doesn’t take federal lobbyist
   money, and just one of eleven Members of Congress who has taken that
   pledge. Washington is too beholden to corporate cash, and it’s time to ban
   federal lobbyist money once and for all.

=========================================Time is running out – friend: Donald Trump is coming to Las Vegas TOMORROW to rally his base in Nevada!
Trump and Republicans have made me a top target for defeat because they know the road to Senate control runs right through Nevada.
Polls are showing me neck and neck with my billionaire-backed, GOP opponent, so I need YOUR urgent help to fight back. With Nevada on track to be the most competitive battleground state this year, Republicans won’t spare a penny to defeat me and retake both Senate and White House control.
My request to you is this: Make a donation right now to keep Nevada blue and defend our Democratic Senate and White House.
You read that right, friend: A group of top Democratic donors who understand how crucial the stakes in this race are have generously agreed to MATCH all gifts to my campaign up to $50,000 until 11:59 p.m. tonight.
So please: Will you make an urgent gift of $5 or more now to help me keep Nevada blue and defend our Democratic Senate majority?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

So when she got older, she wrote this letter to Senator Tom Carper asking for a summer internship in his Wilmington office. With a baby on her hip and a toddler in tow, she went to work serving Delawareans. That office instilled in her the importance of a government that works for everyone.https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.01.31_B1_BioThreePics_Main-45op_RS&amount=25 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.01.31_B1_BioThreePics_Main-45op_RS&amount=25]
From that internship, she went on to serve as a cabinet secretary under two Delaware governors. Then, in 2016, she made history and became the first woman and first person of color to represent Delaware in Congress.https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.01.31_B1_BioThreePics_Main-45op_RS&amount=25 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.01.31_B1_BioThreePics_Main-45op_RS&amount=25]
From college to Congress, people have doubted that a Black woman could overcome the odds. Lisa has proven them wrong every time, and she knows that with your help, she can do it again.

=========================================Friend, everything we've been working toward comes down to this: Right now, we're facing our FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out!
This is our LAST chance to build up the resources we urgently need to keep us sailing into Election Day – and I truly need every single dollar I can get. So please: Can I count on you to donate $5 or more to my Senate campaign now?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode=jtk1002-fr-text
Friend, I'll be blunt: I do not have the resources it takes to compete for TV space in California. My opponents are spending MILLIONS on flooding the airwaves, and any ads I could afford to launch would be drowned out immediately. 
But this race won't be won on TV. It'll be won on the ground – and I just happen to have one of the most impressive grassroots operations in the state. That's why, in these final days, I'm heavily investing in meeting voters where they are. That means more lawn signs, more rallies, more door knockers and more phone bankers.
Friend,  I need your help expanding my voter outreach efforts even further. Your $5 end-of-month donation will help us reach those last voters with my progressive platform and record in these critical last days. So I'm humbly asking: 
Will you donate $5 or more before January ends? We've set the ambitious goal to raise $100,000 online for our last end-of-month deadline before ballots go out, but I can only hit that with your support. 
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode=jtk1002-fr-text
Thank you.

Friend, everything we've been working toward comes down to this: Right now, we're facing our FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out!
This is our LAST chance to build up the resources we urgently need to keep us sailing into Election Day – and I truly need every single dollar I can get. So please: Can I count on you to donate $5 or more to my Senate campaign now?
Contribute
Friend, I'll be blunt: I do not have the resources it takes to compete for TV space in California. My opponents are spending MILLIONS on flooding the airwaves, and any ads I could afford to launch would be drowned out immediately. 
But this race won't be won on TV. It'll be won on the ground – and I just happen to have one of the most impressive grassroots operations in the state. That's why, in these final days, I'm heavily investing in meeting voters where they are. That means more lawn signs, more rallies, more door knockers and more phone bankers.
Friend, I need your help expanding my voter outreach efforts even further. Your $5 end-of-month donation will help us reach those last voters with my progressive platform and record in these critical last days. So I'm humbly asking: 
Will you donate $5 or more before January ends? We've set the ambitious goal to raise $100,000 online for our last end-of-month deadline before ballots go out, but I can only hit that with your support.
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $5
Donate $25

Thank you.
									– Barbara Lee
Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

Can I tell you the story of how I first got involved in politics, friend?
While serving as the president of Nevada's largest synagogue, I was recruited to run in a competitive House race to help flip a red seat blue. Looking back, it's incredibly fitting that this was my entry point to public service – because my Judaism helps guide much of my work in the Senate today.
In fact, my decision to say "yes" and run for public office in the first place was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam – which means to leave the world a better place than how we found it.
Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I'm proud to serve Nevada and our country. And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help.
Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking:
If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you – if you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we love – will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

OFFICIAL END-OF-MONTH SUPPORTER RECORD
SUPPORTER ID: Jengabuiling90@gmail.com
DONATION STATUS: PENDING
SUGGESTED GIFT: $5https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode=jtk1168-fr-text
DEADLINE: 11:59 P.M. TONIGHT
Our fundamental freedoms – from voting rights to reproductive rights – are under GOP attack, and keeping the Senate blue is our BEST hope of protecting them. But that'll be nearly impossible if Democrats lose in Ohio.
Winning here will require nothing short of hitting – even surpassing – important fundraising goals like this, so please, Jenga, don't sit on the sidelines. Will you step up and give $5 or more now to keep Sherrod's seat AND the Senate blue?

=========================================https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT5zAofQ6Ek [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT5zAofQ6Ek]                                                                                                                                                                                             
Friend, I’m thrilled to welcome you to the team that’s going to help defend our Democratic Senate majority. Allow me to introduce myself and share a little bit about why I’m running for the U.S. Senate.                                                         
My work in Congress has always been defined by who I am and where I come from. I grew up in a working-class family; my mom was a public school teacher and my dad was a salesman for Trans World Airlines. When I was 11, my dad moved the family to start a working farm.            
My brothers and I carried much of the load, collecting eggs, cleaning hog pens and chicken houses, and all the other work a farm requires. It was tough, but the farm taught us the value of hard work, determination, and persistence.                                               
When our family fell on hard times, my father filed for bankruptcy and we lost the farm. From that point on, I learned there's no shame in asking for help – but there is in not helping.                                                                                             
That’s why I’m running for Senate – to bring Marylanders together to solve big problems like the opioid crisis, criminal justice reform, and mental health. But no one runs for office alone so I’ll need folks like you involved every step of the way.                              
If you have a moment, learn more about why I’m in this race, our vision for Maryland, and how I plan to represent you in the Senate. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT5zAofQ6Ek]

Hey! I wanted to take a moment and personally introduce myself. My name is 
Kari Lake, and I’m running for U.S. Senate in the great state of Arizona.
Although I grew up in Iowa, my home AND my heart lies in Arizona. Reflecting 
on my childhood, I am astounded by my parent’s resilience. They raised nine 
kids on two paychecks.

Today that would be impossible. The cost of living has never been higher. 
American families have never suffered as much as they are right now.It’s time 
for some change. 
<https://secure.anedot.com/kari-lake-for-senate/dbe454de-0561-4b08-8141-2c9b8ddffeef>
I have two kids of my own now, and I refuse to leave them in a country where 
THE American Dream is out of reach.
I’ve tried my best to be a Mama Bear: I’ve worked hard and raised my family, 
all while remaining ignorant of the grand illusion that this country has been 
building around us.
<https://secure.anedot.com/kari-lake-for-senate/dbe454de-0561-4b08-8141-2c9b8ddffeef?amount=25>
In reality — we’ve lost control of the destiny of this nation. At some point, 
the American voters got sidelined in favor of Washington’s agenda, which 
doesn’t include the best interest of everyday Americans like you and me.
 THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. 
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

In Arizona, I built the largest grassroots movement in the history of this 
nation, and I want to make sure every Arizonan and American gets the 
opportunity to let their voice be heard. I spent years in the newsroom, looking 
at the BS & Propaganda the media masters wanted the American people to hear. 
Now — I’m kicking this campaign into full gear; we will FIGHT and WIN. At all 
costs! 
I have just as much at stake in this election as you do; I have two beautiful 
children and a loving husband. The only thing I want more in the world is for 
my family to live a life FREE of the government’s control and the opportunity 
to live the American Dream.
I’ve been a fighter all my life. I don’t intend to stop now. I’m on a mission 
for all of US, and I’m fighting for the forgotten people of this nation who’ve 
been left behind Washington’s narrow-minded agenda.
I’m in this fight for US. We will fight, and we will WIN, by ANY MEANS 
NECESSARY.
Unfortunately, I can’t do this alone, I need your help!

I wanted to take a moment and personally introduce myself. My name is Kari Lake, and I’m running for U.S. Senate in the great state of Arizona. Although I grew up in Iowa, my home AND my heart lies in Arizona. Reflecting on my childhood, I am astounded by my parent’s resilience. They raised nine kids on two paychecks.     JOIN THE MOVEMENT — MAKE HISTORY     Today that would be impossible. The cost of living has never been higher. American families have never suffered as much as they are right now. It’s time for some change. I have two kids of my own now, and I refuse to leave them in a country where THE American Dream is out of reach. I’ve tried my best to be a Mama Bear: I’ve worked hard and raised my family, all while remaining ignorant of the grand illusion that this country has been building around us. In reality — we’ve lost control of the destiny of this nation. At some point, the American voters got sidelined in favor of Washington’s agenda, which doesn’t include the best interest of everyday Americans like you and me.  THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. ONCE AND FOR ALL!     JOIN THE MOVEMENT — MAKE HISTORY     In Arizona, I built the largest grassroots movement in the history of this nation, and I want to make sure every Arizonan and American gets the opportunity to let their voice be heard. I spent years in the newsroom, looking at the BS & Propaganda the media masters wanted the American people to hear. Now — I’m kicking this campaign into full gear; we will FIGHT and WIN. At all costs! I have just as much at stake in this election as you do; I have two beautiful children and a loving husband. The only thing I want more in the world is for my family to live a life FREE of the government’s control and the opportunity to live the American Dream. I’ve been a fighter all my life.

=========================================I don’t like coming to you like this but as of 1pm, I’m still $4,309 short of my first End of Month budget goal of the year. I’m reaching out to folks who haven’t chipped in yet to see if you’ll help close the gap in these final 24 hours. Is there any way I can count on your $15? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240130_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]
I’ll cut straight to it:
We’ve made so much progress over the last month, but I’m still $4,309 short of hitting the first End of Month Deadline of 2024 – with only 24 hours to close the gap.
I hate to ask, but I know there is just too much at stake for too many families if we don’t put everything we have into this race and this opportunity to reclaim this seat for grassroots Democrats.
It would mean so much to me if I could count on your $15 in these final 24 hours:

I became so fed up watching politicians – like Republican Senator Kevin Cramer – stuff their pockets with special interest cash and ignore the needs of everyday Americans.
– I watched vulnerable seniors forced to choose between paying for medications or keeping the lights on.
– I watched hardworking parents who struggled to put food on the table or send their kids to college.
– I watched caring families torn apart as their loved ones battled addiction.
So, I decided to run for U.S. Senate to fight for the people who’ve been left behind.
I’m closing in on my first End of Month Deadline of the year – and the world will be watching to see if we can keep up our momentum. That’s why it’s so critical we close our $4,309 fundraising gap in the next 24 hours. I know what grassroots Democrats are capable of when we have each other's backs. So, can I count on you to have my back with $15 ahead of my critical deadline in 24 hours? If we can clinch this goal, we’ll prove the strength of our movement to FLIP this seat for Democrats and show Kevin Cramer he can’t just purchase this seat with special interest cash. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240130_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

=========================================   What a month. 
We put out our 2023 FEC numbers earlier this month and put Kari Lake to shame. 
We remembered the anniversary of January 6th. 
We celebrated the one year anniversary of launching this campaign together. 
And today we are starting the fundraising drive to our end-of-month deadline on January 31st. 
This is the first major fundraising deadline of the year, and we need it to be a big one. Because if we’re going to beat Kari Lake at the voting booth this November, we need to beat her fundraising every single month of the year. 
We need to raise enough resources to fight off anything that comes our way — and with an opponent like Kari Lake, there’s no telling what that might be. 
To do that, we need you to make a online donation. Make it for whatever you can. But please, just make that donation.

=========================================Well, team, as I’m sure you’ve seen by now, Trump won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. He’s a step closer to grabbing the Republican nomination for president.
Trump’s wins come on the heels of his latest comments on the Supreme Court:
“For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it… And I’m proud to have done it.”
Trump did indeed confirm three of the extremist justices who overturned Roe. As a result, millions of American women had their freedom taken away, and here Trump is, bragging about it. And even worse? If he wins again in November AND the GOP take back the Senate? They’ll have a nationwide abortion ban ready to go.
We have to take this threat seriously.
That’s why I’m personally asking if you can donate to my campaign ahead of our end-of-month fundraising deadline to send me back to the Senate and support my work to expand our Democratic Senate majority and send Joe Biden back to the White House.

and the future of the Supreme Court. 
Well, team, as I’m sure you’ve seen by now, Trump won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. He’s a step closer to grabbing the Republican nomination for president. 
Trump’s wins come on the heels of his latest comments on the Supreme Court:
“For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it… And I’m proud to have done it.” 
Trump did indeed confirm three of the extremist justices who overturned Roe. As a result, millions of American women had their freedom taken away, and here Trump is, bragging about it. And even worse? If he wins again in November AND the GOP take back the Senate? They’ll have a nationwide abortion ban ready to go.
We have to take this threat seriously.
That’s why I’m personally asking if you can donate to my campaign ahead of our end-of-month fundraising deadline to send me back to the Senate and support my work to expand our Democratic Senate majority and send Joe Biden back to the White House.
With your help, Democrats can reverse the trajectory of reproductive freedom and our Supreme Court.
Thank you,
Sheldon Whitehouse

=========================================Jenga, our race in Ohio is heating up – so I needed to reach out directly to give you an update:
First, CNN ranked me as one of the most vulnerable senators in the entire country.
Then, my potential opponent – a self-funding GOP millionaire – went on the offensive, flooding the airwaves with an attack ad against me.
Now, I'm falling short of my $250,000 end-of-month goal – and if support doesn't pick up in the next couple of hours, I'm afraid we won't have the proper resources to fight back.
Experts at FiveThirtyEight say this race could decide Senate control. I know it might seem early, but failing to respond to the GOP's attacks right now could have a serious impact on our ability to keep Ohio and the Senate blue. That's why I have to ask, Jenga:
Please, will you chip in $5 or more now to help me hit my end-of-month goal, win in Ohio, and defend the Senate?

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Friend, I have to ask again before the month ends:
Can you spare $5 to invest in my campaign to defeat Ted Cruz? 
Since a new poll from just weeks ago showed us statistically tied, Cruz and his team have been sounding the alarm bells – and I want to send a message loud and clear that we aren't stopping until Texans have the leadership we deserve.
I know: $5 isn't much compared to the MILLIONS that Ted is getting from his corporate allies. But I'm willing to bet that if everyone who's fired up to beat him chips in $5, we can blow his extremist mega donors out of the water. 
So, please: Will you chip in $5 right now so that we can continue through this election year with the resources to reach voters across Texas? We need to raise $500,000 before my end-of-month deadline tomorrow to be in the best possible spot to win in November.

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================   Hey, 
I need to ask you to make a donation to my campaign before our first end-of-month deadline of the year hits tomorrow night. 
I’ve been trying to figure out the best way to convince you to make that donation. Here’s what I know to be true: 
If we lose in Arizona we will lose our Senate majority. 
That’s not up for debate — it’s a fact. We have zero margin for error. Kari Lake lost her last election by about 17,000 votes. To put that into context, that’s less than a third as many people who attended the Super Bowl last year. 
Less than a third of a football stadium. 
Less than 1% of all votes cast. 
And right now, we’re not raising the kind of money that can defeat her and win a Senate race. 
That’s why I’m reaching out to my top supporters. Because we really need to catch up. 
Will you make that donation?, Anything you can afford to give, would go a long way. Help me defend our Senate majority and make that donation before we hit our end-of-month deadline.

   You probably enjoy reading these emails about as much as I enjoy writing
   them, Jenga. But
   we’re facing a shortfall to our January fundraising goal, so I had to
   reach out.
   With Senate Republicans working overtime to flip this Senate seat —
   especially now that they’ve hand picked megamillionaire self-funder Eric
   Hovde to run against me — I’m getting worried about our fundraising.
   We’ve fallen behind where we’re supposed to be and are at risk of missing
   our first end-of-month fundraising goal of the year.
   Look, I’m not panicking just yet — I just wanted to be truthful about why
   I’m writing you this email and why I’m humbly asking for your support:

You probably enjoy reading these emails about as much as I enjoy writing them, Jenga. But we’re facing a shortfall to our January fundraising goal, so I had to reach out.
With Senate Republicans working overtime to flip this Senate seat — especially now that they’ve hand picked megamillionaire self-funder Eric Hovde to run against me — I’m getting worried about our fundraising.
We’ve fallen behind where we’re supposed to be and are at risk of missing our first end-of-month fundraising goal of the year.
Look, I’m not panicking just yet — I just wanted to be truthful about why I’m writing you this email and why I’m humbly asking for your support:
Can you rush a donation before our end-of-month deadline? Anything you can give will make a dent toward our fundraising gap before Wednesday’s deadline.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
CHIP IN $5 NOW
CHIP IN $10 NOW
CHIP IN $25 NOW
CHIP IN $50 NOW
CHIP IN $100 NOW
ANOTHER AMOUNT
I’m so grateful that I can always count on you in moments like this.

Jenga , our FIRST end-of-month goal of the election year is TONIGHT at 
MIDNIGHT, and I need your help.
I know Election Day seems a far way away, but trust me when I say it will 
creep up on us sooner than we think. Tim Kaine and the Democrat machine in 
Virginia are raising MILLIONS to try and stop us from taking back the Senate, 
and we need to build a war chest if we’re going to be able to fight back.
 The path to the Senate majority runs right through Virginia, and if we win, 
we have a real shot at taking back the Senate majority.
If we have ANY CHANCE of beating Tim Kaine, I need your urgent help Jenga . 
This is our most important deadline yet, and EVERYONE will be watching to see 
if we meet our goal.
Whatever you can spare will make a HUGE difference. Please, pitch in a few 
dollars or whatever you can to the link below before MIDNIGHT TONIGHT so we can 
meet our FIRST goal of the election year!

=========================================Jenga, 
I’ll make this quick - I’m EXTREMELY worried.
Our end of month deadline is tonight at midnight, and we still must raise 
$10,839.
 I’m counting on my grassroots team more than ever, and that means YOU, Jenga,.
If we miss this goal, we have NO chance at taking back President Trump’s 
majority in the Senate.
I’m begging you, Jenga - please pitch in before TONIGHT at MIDNIGHT so we can 
meet our FIRST FEC deadline of the election year!

   I need you to read this immediately,
   Jenga: A new
   poll out of PA shows Bob’s lead slipping.
   For decades, I’ve worked to elect Democrats in tough races across the
   country. I’ve seen and analyzed thousands of polls, and here’s my expert
   advice: National Republicans are going to see this and zero in on this
   race. They see PA as the path to taking back the Senate and the White
   House, and they’re not wrong.
   What happens here will decide the fate of our country.
   That’s why I’m emailing you today. If we don’t turn our attention towards
   Bob Casey’s race, we’ll pay the price in November.
   I’ve seen this story play out too many times. This poll is the latest
   indicator that PA’s Senate race will be the most competitive in the
   country, and we have got to get serious. If we don’t, it could be the
   difference between winning and losing.

=========================================So many of you have been asking what I’ve been up to on the campaign trail, so I wanted to take a minute to share some highlights from my most recent trip. If you’re short on time, will you consider pitching in $15 to help me travel to every corner of North Dakota to meet voters where they’re at ahead of this incredibly competitive election? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240205_em_fr_b1_nkatrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]
I knew from day one I wanted to visit every corner of North Dakota.
I want this to be a campaign where I can get to know voters, ask questions, and listen to the issues their families are facing – because North Dakota is all about getting to know your neighbors.
That’s why talking to people in our grocery stores, gas stations, and everywhere in between is so important to me.
This past week I was in Minot doing just that.
Reaching voters in the early days of the election year couldn’t be more critical – and there’s still a lot more ground to cover in North Dakota. So I’m counting on 672 donors to replenish my campaign’s voter outreach fund. Can you pitch in $15 before midnight to help me get on the road and meet as many North Dakota voters as possible before November? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240205_em_fr_b1_nkatrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]
On the campaign trail, folks always tell me they are tired of career politicians putting special interests over us.
I’m tired too – that’s why I got into this race.
I know what it’s like to live on a fixed income. I know what it’s like to struggle.
I’m running to give working and middle-class folks a seat at the table.
So believe me: I care about making sure every voter’s story is heard.
Will you chip in $15 before midnight to help me travel to every pocket of North Dakota and connect with the voters I need to win this race? I need 672 gifts before midnight to ensure I have the resources needed to reach key voters before Cramer does and deliver a win for regular folks. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240205_em_fr_b1_nkatrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

Will you chip in $15 before midnight to help me travel to every pocket of North Dakota and connect with the voters I need to win this race? I need 672 gifts before midnight to ensure I have the resources needed to reach key voters before Cramer does and deliver a win for regular folks. >>

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
						Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

=========================================Friend – with only hours left before the critical midnight deadline, I'm falling just short of my goal to win in Nevada and defend the Senate. I need your urgent help to close the gap.
Missing this important goal isn't an option, because the GOP is zeroing in on defeating me: Mitch McConnell personally recruited a far-right Republican to run against me, and a shady billionaire has poured $2 million into his effort to help flip this seat.
The only way I can fight back is if people like you rush your immediate grassroots support before midnight tonight. So with Senate control at stake, I'm personally asking: Will you give $5 now – or even $25 – to help me hit my January goal, win in Nevada, and defend the Senate?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.

   Hi Jenga, Angela Alsobrooks here! I’m a lifelong Marylander,
   mom, former elected prosecutor, and County Executive of Prince George’s
   County, and now…
   I’m running to become Maryland’s next United States Senator!
   Before I tell you all about why I decided to run, I want to make you a
   simple promise: I will always take the time to learn from and listen to
   you. I’ll work diligently every single day to make this community proud.
   The truth is, there aren’t that many people in the Senate who live and
   think like the people they were elected to represent. I know the people of
   Maryland should have a Senator who not only fights for them, but who also
   understands and shares their concerns.
   The journey we’re beginning today is an investment in a better tomorrow,
   for Maryland and for our country. I can’t tell you how grateful I am that
   you’re by my side,
   Jenga.

   Each time I’ve run for office, it’s because I recognized a problem that I
   had the right tools to fix.
   That’s the outlook handed down to me by my great-grandmother, Maebell
   James. She was the strongest woman I’ve ever met. She prevailed over
   cruelty and injustice in her life with inexhaustible dignity.
   She had one rule for her family: No complaints.
   She’d often say, “If you don't like something, you go farther and you do
   better.”
   That lesson lived on through my hard-working parents. They taught me what
   integrity looks like and to respect all work.
   Their example led me to run for office for the first time 13 years ago,
   right here in Prince George’s County. I fought to develop new economic
   opportunities, improve the health, safety, and security of our
   communities, and strengthen our education system.
   I’m deeply proud of the things we’ve accomplished so far – but in
   Washington, there’s plenty of work left to do. With a little determination
   and a good attitude, I know we can go farther and do better for all
   Marylanders.
   There will be bumps on the journey ahead. But as I write this, there’s not
   a doubt in my mind that we’ll overcome them together.

But (there's always a but) we still have a long way to go to defeat Ted Cruz. This news has Ted sounding the alarm, and his wealthy Republican allies are just waiting to come to his rescue. Colin's running a true grassroots campaign, which means he's counting on folks like you to donate to emails like this one to help us keep up this momentum.
That's why we have to ask: With just over two days to go until our first end-of-month deadline of the election year, will you chip in $5 or more to help reach our $500,000 goal? Every dollar helps make sure we can keep pace with Ted Cruz, work to pull ahead in the polls, and help Colin Allred bring real leadership to Texas! →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================Friend, I was just having my coffee when my finance director sent me our latest fundraising numbers. 
I'm not going to lie – January has been really tough for fundraising, and our end-of-month deadline is coming up tomorrow.
And here's the thing: Ted Cruz's GOP mega donors are more laser-focused on this race than ever. They're pouring millions into his campaign to make sure Ted continues to protect their interests in the Senate.
Unlike Ted Cruz, I'm running in this race to protect the interests of ALL Texans, not special-interest groups. I’m running to defend our fundamental right to vote, improve affordable health care, and build a Texas we can be proud of. 
And if folks like you help power this campaign all the way through Election Day, I know we'll have what it takes to stand up to Cruz and his allies.
But I noticed you haven't made a donation toward our $500,000 end-of-month goal yet, and I'm still falling $121,756 short, and our deadline is at midnight tomorrow. So please: Can you give just $5 now to make sure we can retire Ted Cruz for good? Every dollar you give brings us closer to giving Texans a Senator that speaks for us in the Senate – not shady mega donors. →https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw-allred-email-jan-2024?refcode=jtk1256-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250

=========================================Sen. Sherrod Brown
Friend – I know you're probably busy, so I'll get right to it:
I'm in a dead heat with my opponents in Ohio's Senate race, and I can only surge ahead if I reach my $50,000 fundraising goal before our midnight deadline. So please, is there anything I can say to convince you to split $5 between my campaign and Jacky Rosen’s to defend our Democratic majority in the Senate?
Would it make a difference if I told you that Mitch McConnell is coming after me as a top target to flip the Senate red?
What if I told you that my three GOP opponents are millionaires who can self-fund their campaigns – and one of them just spent $2 million to flood the airwaves with TV ads in Ohio?
And, what if I told you that with polls showing me neck and neck with my opponents, we're still falling short of our midnight goal with just hours until the deadline?
So, what do you say, friend? If you're ready to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority, please split $5 between my campaign and Jacky’s now.

KEVIN CRAMER IS AN AMERICA FIRST REPUBLICAN COMMITTED TO GETTING OUR COUNTRY 
BACK ON TRACK 
 Dear Patriot, 
 I want to thank you for joining my team. It is a privilege to represent each 
of you in the Senate, and I am eager to fight for you in the years ahead.
 I have a strong track record of defending our rights and thwarting the 
radical Left's attempts to dismantle our great nation. I am tirelessly working 
in the Senate to uphold the rule of law, protect jobs, champion our children's 
future, and counter the woke agenda. Today's America falls short of the great 
America I grew up in, and I am determined to rebuild the country we cherish.
 As a proud North Dakota native and staunch constitutional conservative, I 
understand our community’s challenges. I am devoted to upholding conservative 
principles and safeguarding our American way of life.I hope you will join me in 
the fight to rescue our country from the radical Left!

 This battle has just begun! Together, we have the power to combat the woke 
agenda, advocate for an economy that respects individuals' hard-earned money, 
and prioritize the well-being of Americans.
 I am fully committed to fighting for the people of our great country, and I 
am thrilled to have you by my side.
With your support, we can uphold our conservative principles and flip the 
Senate in 2024.

It is a privilege to represent each of you in the Senate, and I am eager to fight for you in the years ahead.  I have a strong track record of defending our rights and thwarting the radical Left's attempts to dismantle our great nation. I am tirelessly working in the Senate to uphold the rule of law, protect jobs, champion our children's future, and counter the woke agenda. Today's America falls short of the great America I grew up in, and I am determined to rebuild the country we cherish.  As a proud North Dakota native and staunch constitutional conservative, I understand our community’s challenges. I am devoted to upholding conservative principles and safeguarding our American way of life. I hope you will join me in the fight to rescue our country from the radical Left!  This battle has just begun! Together, we have the power to combat the woke agenda, advocate for an economy that respects individuals' hard-earned money, and prioritize the well-being of Americans.  I am fully committed to fighting for the people of our great country, and I am thrilled to have you by my side.  With your support, we can uphold our conservative principles and flip the Senate in 2024.  Please keep in touch!

=========================================I’m running for the United States Senate because I don’t want my daughter to grow up with fewer rights than I had. Reports like this remind me how much is at stake:
- - - 
[Screenshot from a POLITICO report entitled The Anti-Abortion Plan Ready for Trump on Day One]
CHIP IN & FIGHT BACK >> https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tmnj-em-q12024
- - -
At the moment, New Jersey is a safe haven for girls and women who simply want to make their own healthcare decisions without government interference, but if Republicans win in November, no state will be safe from their extreme, anti-freedom agenda.
We don’t just need Democrats in Washington; we need fearless Democratic women who will make defending reproductive freedom their top priority. That’s exactly who I am and who I will be.
We also need candidates willing to run with reproductive freedom at the heart of their campaign. Protecting abortion access and women’s rights is a winning issue; when people of all political backgrounds hear what is at stake, they will turn out and vote.
So  will you chip in today to help me secure the Democratic nomination, win in November, and fight for reproductive rights from New Jersey to Washington?
DONATE NOW: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tmnj-em-q12024     
Our daughters deserve all the freedoms we had and more. Please help me fight on their behalf by chipping in today.
Thank you,
Tammy

=========================================Friend, I'm emailing you today to say thank you. Here's why:
When I launched my campaign to defeat Ted Cruz back in May, I knew that I couldn't win without building the biggest grassroots movement that Texas has ever seen. 
But I had no idea that this team would blow my every expectation out of the water, and that we would build the most dedicated movement for change that any candidate could hope for. 
Through every ambitious end-of-month goal, every late-night ask, and every urgent call to action, supporters like you had my back when I needed it most.
To our 200,000+ Team Allred donors, I'm so very grateful for an incredible year. 
But as we get closer to Election Day I'm counting on this team to power through the finish line.
If we want to beat Ted Cruz in November, it's absolutely critical that we kick off the election year with the resources we need to reach MILLIONS of voters at their doors, on their phones, and in their mailboxes.
That's why I have to ask today: Will you chip in $5 now so that I can be in the best possible spot to send Ted Cruz packing and give Texans the leadership they deserve? →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================Friend, $25.85 might not seem like a lot – but it's how we're building this unprecedented movement to defeat Ted Cruz.
Since Colin launched his campaign, we've seen an average donation of just $25.85 from emails like this one. Together, with thousands of grassroots supporters like you, $25.85 is doing so much:
* We're showing Republicans we're serious about fighting back against their extremism and protecting our fundamental rights.  
* We're building the infrastructure necessary to reach the undecided voters we need to retire Ted Cruz for good. 
* We're hiring staff, running critical ads, opening our Campaign HQ, and building a massive grassroots movement like Texas has never seen before! 
Colin can win on Election Day – but your $25.85 is critical to building a movement that can win.

=========================================BREAKING NEWS: The Supreme Court heard a case that could END Social Security!
Jenga, Republicans have spent years scheming to destroy Social Security. And now, Trump's far-right majority on the Supreme Court could be preparing to OVERTURN this critical legislation.
Over the past 88 years, Social Security has helped hundreds of millions of Americans pay their bills and retire with dignity. Today, 67 million people receive benefits — that's 1 in every 5 Americans!
Social Security is, without a doubt, one of the most important — and popular — pieces of legislation ever passed. But now, the future of this vital program rests in the hands of far-right radicals on the Supreme Court.
These extremists have already made it clear that they have no respect for precedent or the will of the American people. We cannot sit on the sidelines and watch as they strip away our benefits. We have to make our voices heard NOW. Please, respond before 11:59 p.m. tonight to tell us:
Should the Supreme Court Protect Social Security?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

=========================================We'll be honest, Jenga, we're concerned.
First, Politico reported that our Democratic Senate majority could hinge on winning in Ohio.
Then, multiple outlets, from FiveThirtyEight to CNN ranked Sherrod as one of the most vulnerable incumbents on the ballot. 
Now, experts at NBC News say this race is sure to be one of the "nastiest and most expensive in the country" – right as we're falling short of our critical $250,000 end-of-month goal!
A clown car of Republicans are running against us and our end-of-month deadline is approaching fast, so we're counting on your help to close the gap and protect Sherrod's must-win seat before it's too late. Jenga, we can prove the pundits wrong, win in Ohio, and defend the Senate – but only with your grassroots support:
So please, will you chip in $5 or more right now? Every dollar makes a critical difference in our ability to keep the Senate blue.

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work.

No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.

=========================================It's Barbara Lee, and I'm personally reaching out to you about our FINAL critical end-of-month deadline before ballots go out, Friend.
There are just 34 days until polls close, but people are going to begin casting their vote for California's next senator much earlier. This is truly our final push before Election Day – but with just a few hours left until the deadline, we're still falling short of our goal.
Friend, I urgently need this money to expand my GOTV efforts – from more phone bankers to door knockers to so much more ... but I'm counting on you. This is the last time I'm asking before the end-of-month deadline: Please, will you chip in $5 right now to help us secure the resources we need to reach every last voter?

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Jenga – I have some good news to share, and I wanted you to see it right away.
Recent polling shows me 1 point ahead of my GOP opponents in this must-win race! This is a direct result of our hard work, and a sign that our fight for the Dignity of Work is resonating with voters – but I need your help to keep it up. 
So please, ahead of my end-of-month deadline on Wednesday, will you chip in $5 or more to help reach our $250,000 goal, keep up this momentum, and stay ahead in this battleground race?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1159-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
The stakes of our race haven't changed: Our Democratic Senate majority hinges on what happens here in Ohio, and CNN is still calling me one of the most vulnerable senators in the entire country.
My GOP opponents are pouring millions into this race – they’ll probably dump in millions more now to try and catch up – and they've got everyone from Donald Trump to Mitch McConnell pledging to help defeat me.
But with your grassroots support at this critical stage in the race, Jenga, I know we can win. It's how I've won every tough race before and how we've gotten to be 1 point ahead in this one. 
I'm counting on you to be with me every step of the way, so please: Ahead of the first end-of-month deadline of the election year, will you rush $5 or more right now to help me win in Ohio and defend our Senate majority?

=========================================I've got to be honest with you Jenga, I'm a bit worried.
First, polls showed me neck and neck with my GOP opponents – in the race experts say will decide Senate control.
Then, my Trump-backed opponent spent $2 MILLION to flood the airwaves with TV ads so he could turn the tide against us and flip this seat.
Now, we launched a brand-new TV ad to fight back and pull ahead – but unless we reach our critical midnight fundraising goal, our ad could go dark, and we could cede the airwaves to our opponent.
With all our progress on the line – from higher wages to reproductive freedom – we can't afford to take a single day off. Because that could mean the difference between keeping the Senate blue and handing control back to Mitch McConnell.
So here's my ask for you, Jenga: Please, will you chip in $5 or more to help us keep our ads on the air, win in Ohio, and defend our Senate majority?

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.
									Thank you!

=========================================I won't mince words, Jenga: January has been a tough month. With experts saying Senate control is at stake in this race, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and my self-funding GOP opponents are doing whatever it takes to defeat me.
After they launched vicious attack ads to try and flip this seat, polling showed this race neck and neck. We need to fight back ASAP, but if we fail to reach our end-of-month fundraising goal, I'm worried we won't have the resources we need to do it.
So I'm asking one last time before the midnight deadline: Will you please chip in $5 or more now to help me win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue?

After they launched vicious attack ads to try and flip this seat, polling showed this race neck and neck. We need to fight back ASAP, but if we fail to reach our end-of-month fundraising goal, I'm worried we won't have the resources we need to do it.
So I'm asking one last time before the midnight deadline: Will you please chip in $5 or more now to help me win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue?

=========================================$26. 
I'm proud to share that $26 is the average grassroots donation to our campaign, Jenga.
I know that might not seem like much when you think about the tens of millions that GOP super PACs are going to spend to try to defeat me and flip the Senate. But that's the power of this grassroots movement – it's made up of folks like you who believe in this fight and chip in what they can, when they can.
This movement is how we're going to defy the pundits who are calling me one of the most vulnerable senators in the country, win in Ohio, and defend our Senate majority. 
But here's the problem: The Cook Political Report ranks this race a toss-up – and Washington Republicans are already launching attack ads against me. We need all hands on deck to fight back – but right now, we're coming up short.
If everyone reading this email chipped in $26 – or even just a few dollars – we could reach our $25,000 midnight fundraising goal before the deadline. But not everyone will, so I'm personally asking if I can count on you, Jenga.
Please, will you chip in $26 – or as much as you can right now – to help me fight back against GOP attacks, defend this seat, and keep the Senate blue?

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.
									Thank you!

   I have a meeting with the Senator this afternoon to discuss our

   wanted us to be.
   I’m looking at my spreadsheet, and we’re still $55,000 shy of hitting our
   January fundraising target. And since we were outraised by David McCormick

   I’d love to show the boss that things are turning around today.

Hi Jenga, it’s Roland, the candidate running to unseat Ted Cruz in the U.S. Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
I was grateful to join CNN recently to discuss the fight for common-sense gun control.

It’s important that we as Americans understand the kind of horror that took place in Uvalde.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Right here in my backyard — down the road from my home — 21 people lost their lives in a school shooting that could have been prevented.                                                                                                                                                                   
It’s something those poor families will have to relive for the rest of their lives — all because politicians like Ted Cruz were too cowardly to actually do something about our country’s gun violence epidemic.                                                                                           
It’s time for politicians to stop being cowards. And I’m committed to bringing back bold, courageous leadership to Texas, but I need your help to get the job done.

Hi Jenga, it’s Roland, the candidate running to unseat Ted Cruz in the U.S. Senate.
						I was grateful to join CNN recently to discuss the fight for common-sense gun control.
Take a look at what I had to say, and if you’re able, rush in $10 or more to help spread my pro-gun reform message to every last corner of Texas. >>
						It’s important that we as Americans understand the kind of horror that took place in Uvalde.
						Right here in my backyard — down the road from my home — 21 people lost their lives in a school shooting that could have been prevented.
						It’s something those poor families will have to relive for the rest of their lives — all because politicians like Ted Cruz were too cowardly to actually do something about our country’s gun violence epidemic.
It’s time for politicians to stop being cowards. And I’m committed to bringing back bold, courageous leadership to Texas, but I need your help to get the job done. So can I count on you to join me in this fight with $10 or more straight away?

========================================= Jenga,
 You might not have seen this but Dave McCormick and I published an op-ed in the wake of the horrendous October 7th terrorist attack on Israel, where we called on Democrats in Washington to rescind visas from any foreign national who openly supports or advocates for Hamas.
The reason we published this article is because Dave and I truly believe that America is the greatest country to have ever existed. We want people here who love America, not people who hate our great country. We both have been able to live our own American Dream stories because of the opportunities and freedoms that this country offers.
What has set this country apart is the American Dream. The idea that if you worked hard you could provide a good life for yourself and your family. This country affords the greatest opportunities to live, work, and raise a family.
But with the increase in these pro-terrorist protests, sky-high inflation, an increase in crime, and open borders, I know that the Democrats&rsquo; failing policies are making the American Dream more distant.
That&rsquo;s why I wanted to reach out to you, freedom-loving Americans who want to live your own American Dream.
https://click.email.davemccormickpa.com/?qs=86eab9b6672dbe28808ad027d68e8c9323a12763d4778635b7d048ac55941c0d1c91951013ffa39c5b91142a332cabff7bf40b7a60658c198afcfc7c63f2c128 
Do you think the American Dream is slipping away? 
Please take a minute out of your day to let me know what you think about the American Dream. Your input is critical to me, Dave, and other leaders in Washington as we try to represent you.
Thank you,
https://click.email.davemccormickpa.com/?qs=86eab9b6672dbe28808ad027d68e8c9323a12763d4778635b7d048ac55941c0d1c91951013ffa39c5b91142a332cabff7bf40b7a60658c198afcfc7c63f2c128

  My name is Dave McCormick and I&rsquo;m running for the U.S. Senate. 
I&rsquo;m a seventh-generation Pennsylvanian who grew up in a small, rural town called Bloomsburg. My parents, both teachers, instilled in us the responsibility to work at a young age. Summers were spent trimming Christmas trees and baling hay. To this day, my family and I still own a working farm in Bloomsburg.
On weekends, you'd find me bussing tables at the local Magee Hotel, but my passion for football and wrestling gave me purpose and a sense of belonging. It eventually led me to West Point, where I wrestled and was co-captain of the Army wrestling team. 
My time at West Point laid the foundation of duty, honor, and country that has guided me through life ever since. I'm a proud combat veteran, having served in the 82nd Airborne Division during the First Gulf War. Upon returning, I became a successful businessman and job creator in Pittsburgh, growing the tech company I helped run from 70 employees to over 1,000. Then, I had the great honor of serving in the highest levels of government. Afterwards, I helped lead one of the world's largest investment firms. 
 I've truly lived the American Dream, and my life's journey reflects that.
Growing up in Pennsylvania set the stage for the trajectory of the rest of my life, and I am committed to ensuring that every American, regardless of where they start, has the same opportunity to fulfill their dreams that I had growing up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, as it stands today, those dreams are at risk. 
We are at a breaking point and the direction we choose to go will chart the course for the future of Pennsylvania and our country. 
Time and again, America has proved resilient in the face of adversity. I have a plan and the experience to move our commonwealth forward.
 I am a battle-tested leader who is ready to fight for YOU. With Democrats holding the Senate Majority by just one seat, the significance of this Senate race will shape our future, for better or for worse.

Friend, I'm reaching out to you one last time – because I truly believe in
what we've built here.
I know you've already heard: My opponents are spending MILLIONS to flood TV
channels with their campaign ads. And to be honest, the California media
market is too expensive for me to get my own ads on the air.
But that's just fine, because this race won't be decided on TV – it'll be
determined on the ground. That's why I'm investing heavily in my grassroots
operation – which means more people to knock on doors, more people to phone
bank and more Californians reached with my progressive vision.
*Friend, this is exactly how we'll pull ahead in this race, but I need your
support to keep the momentum going strong. I need to raise **$100,000**
before midnight tonight to help me hit my voter outreach goal, so please: *
*Can I count on you to chip in just $5 to my campaign now to boost this
grassroots movement across the finish line? Ballots go out in just a couple
of weeks.

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next
Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to
ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling
the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25
years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being
outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

the state. *Because with recent polling showing that a large number of
California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more
into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.*

=========================================“Republicans Are Making ‘Dark Money’ Even Darker for 2024”
- The Daily Beast, 1/11/24
There’s not much more to say here, team.
Right-wing dark money networks are getting ready to prop up the GOP in this year’s elections. Big polluters, gun manufacturers, and other billionaires are going to drop a lot of cash so they can get what they want — and what they want is at odds with what the American people want.
The good news is that Democrats stand united to end the scourge of dark money in our elections.
But we can’t do it alone. I haven’t shied away from shining a light of transparency on the billionaires’ dark money, so they’ll be watching my re-election campaign closely this year.
Team, will you donate before midnight tonight to support my re-election campaign and help Democrats hold on to the Senate so we can continue the fight to get dark money out of politics? [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sw-email-240129-eom?refcode=sw_em_240131_1_nd

“Republicans Are Making ‘Dark Money’ Even Darker for 2024”
- The Daily Beast, 1/11/24
There’s not much more to say here, team.
Right-wing dark money networks are getting ready to prop up the GOP in this year’s elections. Big polluters, gun manufacturers, and other billionaires are going to drop a lot of cash so they can get what they want — and what they want is at odds with what the American people want.

But we can’t do it alone. I haven’t shied away from shining a light of transparency on the billionaires’ dark money, so they’ll be watching my re-election campaign closely this year.

=========================================Hi, Jenga, it’s Sen. Sherrod Brown from Ohio. I’ve spent my life fighting for the Dignity of Work – and I mean all work. Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, earn a salary or make tips, are raising children or caring for an aging parent, I’ll fight for you. 
I’m running for reelection so I can keep fighting for workers and families in the Senate – but I need your help. Analysts at CNN say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot – and national Republicans are already launching attack ads against me.
The battle for Senate control could all come down to Ohio – so please, I’m personally asking: Will you chip in $5 or more now so we can win in Ohio and defend the Senate?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1169-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
I grew up in Mansfield, Ohio, in a community of ironworkers, carpenters, autoworkers, and electricians. I’m fighting in the Senate every day to bring those jobs back, to build our economy by investing in the middle class, and to ensure hard work pays off for every American.  
But I’m facing my toughest race yet – in a state Donald Trump won by 8 points. In 2022, the Ohio Senate race was one of the most costly and competitive in the nation, and NBC News reports that this one could be “even nastier and more expensive.” 
The long and short of it is, I can’t win – and Democrats simply can’t hold onto our narrow Senate majority – if we don’t have strong grassroots support from folks like you.
That’s why I’m asking for your support today, Jenga: Please, will you chip in $5 or more now so we can win in Ohio and defend the Senate?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1169-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
With gratitude,
Sherrod Brown

I’m running for reelection so I can keep fighting for workers and families in the Senate – but I need your help. ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ ͏‌ 
Hi, Jenga, it’s Sen. Sherrod Brown from Ohio. I’ve spent my life fighting for the Dignity of Work – and I mean all work. Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, earn a salary or make tips, are raising children or caring for an aging parent, I’ll fight for you. 
I’m running for reelection so I can keep fighting for workers and families in the Senate – but I need your help. Analysts at CNN say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot – and national Republicans are already launching attack ads against me.
The battle for Senate control could all come down to Ohio – so please, I’m personally asking: Will you chip in $5 or more now so we can win in Ohio and defend the Senate?
I grew up in Mansfield, Ohio, in a community of ironworkers, carpenters, autoworkers, and electricians. I’m fighting in the Senate every day to bring those jobs back, to build our economy by investing in the middle class, and to ensure hard work pays off for every American.  
But I’m facing my toughest race yet – in a state Donald Trump won by 8 points. In 2022, the Ohio Senate race was one of the most costly and competitive in the nation, and NBC News reports that this one could be “even nastier and more expensive.” 
The long and short of it is, I can’t win – and Democrats simply can’t hold onto our narrow Senate majority – if we don’t have strong grassroots support from folks like you.
That’s why I’m asking for your support today, Jenga: Please, will you chip in $5 or more now so we can win in Ohio and defend the Senate?
With gratitude,
Sherrod Brown

=========================================Friend – 
I know you get a lot of emails from me and my team, and we don't expect you to donate to every single one. But I do hope you'll decide to chip in to this one.
Let me quickly break it down for you: 
* FIRST: Mitch McConnell handpicked my billionaire-backed, anti-choice GOP opponent – who just set a brand-new fundraising record to defeat me here in Nevada!
* THEN: Polling showed me locked in a dead heat in the race that could determine Senate control this November.
* NOW: Time is running out before tomorrow's end-of-month deadline, and we're still way short of our $100,000 goal. 
If everyone reading this contributed just $5, we'd reach our end-of-month goal in minutes. Please, friend, I can't fight back and protect this seat without the critical grassroots support of folks like you. 
That's why I'm humbly asking: Will you give $5 or more right now to help me reach my first end-of-month goal of the year, keep Nevada blue, and defend the Senate for Democrats?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.

=========================================Folks, you don’t need me to tell you how desperate Republicans are to unseat me and flip Wisconsin red… unlike a *hazy* IPA, it’s clear as day.
The GOP knows that the path to the Senate majority runs straight through Wisconsin, so they’ve made me one of their top targets to unseat. Wisconsin is home to some of the most competitive races in the country, and our race this November won’t be any different.
With our campaign’s very first monthly fundraising deadline of 2024 right around the corner, we’re counting on grassroots Democrats like you to pour your support into my reelection campaign to hit our goal.
Can I count on you to split a donation between Maria Cantwell and my campaign before our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of 2024 to help us start the election year on strong footing? Even a pint-sized donation helps in a race as close as ours will be. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc-baldwin?amount=10]

=========================================   Team: 
From this point in the day, we need to raise about $25,000 before our deadline at midnight. 
That’s not something most folks will want to admit — it’s a big number — but the way we’re going to get there is math. Not magic. 
We’re asking you to chip in just $5 right now. We know that $5 doesn’t sound like the kind of donation that can add up to $25,000. But think about this:
If 5000 people chip in $5 right now we’d hit our goal. And we can tell you without any doubt that more than 5000 people are going to open this email. We just need you to take that next step and chip in. 
It’s true what we say — when hundreds or even thousands of folks chip in, we make a ton of progress to our goals. It adds up fast. That’s how we’ve always hit our goals, and that’s how we’ll do it tonight. 
Trump, Kari Lake, and the national GOP are going to target this seat with everything they’ve got. That’s why it’s so important that we hit those goals. 
And that’s why we’re asking you:
PLEASE make that $5 donation before our deadline hits at midnight. We need you to add your $5 to the 5000 others before it’s too late.

Hey there,
When I was sworn-in for the first time in 2017, my sisters and I wanted to make it special. After all, I was making history as the first woman and person of color elected as the Congressperson for Delaware.
My sister Thea is the historian of the family, and she had found this document from our great-great-great grandfather giving him the right to vote in 1867. Thea is also the crafty one of the family and she kindly printed the document onto a scarf for me.

It was surreal – knowing how far my family, and so many families of color, had come. All the way from being enslaved, to finally getting the right to vote, to being elected to represent the First State.
I also carried that scarf on the day of the January 6th insurrection. On such a dark day for our democracy, my scarf served as a reminder that every effort to undermine our democracy has been met with voices of power and reason. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q22023?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_welcome2_Scarf_new&amount=10]
And I intend to carry that scarf when I’m sworn in to the Senate.
If you’re ready to join our movement, will you please chip in $10 to my Senate campaign? Every donation goes towards creating a more diverse and inclusive Congress and I sincerely hope you’ll get on board.

Hey there,
When I was sworn-in for the first time in 2017, my sisters and I wanted to make it special. After all, I was making history as the first woman and person of color elected as the Congressperson for Delaware.
My sister Thea is the historian of the family, and she had found this document from our great-great-great grandfather giving him the right to vote in 1867. Thea is also the crafty one of the family and she kindly printed the document onto a scarf for me.
The day I was sworn-in, I carried that scarf.
It was surreal – knowing how far my family, and so many families of color, had come. All the way from being enslaved, to finally getting the right to vote, to being elected to represent the First State.
I also carried that scarf on the day of the January 6th insurrection. On such a dark day for our democracy, my scarf served as a reminder that every effort to undermine our democracy has been met with voices of power and reason.
And I intend to carry that scarf when I’m sworn in to the Senate.
If you’re ready to join our movement, will you please chip in $10 to my Senate campaign? Every donation goes towards creating a more diverse and inclusive Congress and I sincerely hope you’ll get on board.

   Jenga — Here
   are four numbers you need to know:
   $77 million
   That’s how much Republicans poured into our state to win Wisconsin’s other
   Senate seat in 2022.
   1%
   That’s Republican Senator Ron Johnson's margin of victory in that 2022
   election.
   $20 million
   That’s how much right-wing megamillionaire Eric Hovde is ready to spend to
   defeat Tammy.
   Less than 21,000
   That’s how many votes President Joe Biden won Wisconsin by in the 2020
   presidential election.
   Wisconsin is going to be one of the most competitive states in the nation
   with a toss-up Senate AND Presidential election on the ballot this
   November — and the campaigns are sure to be expensive. That’s why Tammy’s
   counting on your support to keep building the resources it’ll take to keep
   Wisconsin blue.

=========================================                          [1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
   We’re sorry to be reaching out again on a Saturday, so we’ll keep this short.
The truth is we need your help because our fundraising took a hit this month. We had budgeted to be a lot father ahead at this point, so we need an outpouring of support if we’re going to narrow this gap.
Chris is counting on our campaign having the resources to execute an ambitious organizing plan to win his race and races up and down the ballot, and we’re coming up on some important budget decisions that will dictate how ambitious we can be this year.
We cannot afford to falter in the first month of 2024, so we’re asking:
Can you please contribute any amount that you can spare to help us close our budget gap? It would mean a lot to Chris.
CONTRIBUTE: https://act.chrismurphy.com/go/709?t=1001&akid=1807%2E2494310%2E41LPB7
Please know we only ask because this is that important because the overwhelming majority of our donations come from emails just like this one — and not a dime from PACs or corporations.
Thank you!

	We’re sorry to be reaching out again on a Saturday, so we’ll keep this short.
The truth is we need your help because our fundraising took a hit this month. We had budgeted to be a lot further ahead at this point, so we need an outpouring of support if we’re going to narrow this gap.
Chris is counting on our campaign having the resources to execute an ambitious organizing plan to win his race and elect Democrats up and down the ballot, and we’re coming up on some important budget decisions that will dictate how ambitious we can be this year.
We cannot afford to falter in the first month of 2024, so we’re asking:
Can you please contribute $3 or any amount that you can spare to help us close our budget gap? It would mean a lot to Chris.
If you've stored your info with ActBlue, we'll process your contribution instantly.
Donate $3
Donate $25
Donate $50
Donate $100
Donate $250
Other Amount
Please know we only ask because this is that important. The overwhelming majority of our donations come from emails just like this one — and not a dime from PACs or corporations.
Thank you!

=========================================Friend, I found some photos from when I was younger that I would like to share with you.
Images of Representative Lee: as an infant, as a school cheerleader, and as a young woman
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode=jtk1012-fr-text
I was born in El Paso, Texas, via an emergency forceps delivery. My mother's pregnancy wasn't particularly dangerous – but because she was initially denied admission to the hospital while in active labor due to the color of her skin, we both nearly died.
Throughout my childhood, my family and I continued to be treated as lesser. My father was a lieutenant colonel and my mother served as the first Black clerical worker in Fort Bliss – and still, despite all the service they provided for our nation, we were judged by the color of our skin.
But, while my parents couldn't control how the world treated me, they could control how I was taught to treat the world. So they taught me to keep my chin high and never settle for less than I deserved. 
When I was just 15 – after we moved from the deeply segregated South to California – I wanted to be a cheerleader at my high school. But I didn't look like the kind of person the selection committee would choose for the all-white girls cheer team. So I partnered with the NAACP and became my school's first Black girl cheerleader. 
I then went on to become the president of Mills College's Black Student Union, where I had the honor of meeting our nation's first Black congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm. She took one look at me – a young single mother who was so passionate about getting an education that I even took my boys with me to class when I couldn't afford child care – and knew that I would one day create the change that women like me needed. I heeded Rep. Chisholm's words and registered to vote, thus beginning a long journey that ended in Washington, D.C.
And when I saw the opportunity to represent California's 12th Congressional District, I put my head down and worked hard – winning the special election and following in Shirley Chisholm's footsteps.
Now, I'm the only Black woman in the California Senate primary – and I'm ready to take the experience, struggles and voice of Black women to the Senate. 
Friend, with just 32 days to go until the election, the latest polls show this race is wide open. So please, to help me leave my mark, build a progressive future that works for all and become our nation's fourth Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate:
Can I count on you to chip in $5 or more now so that Black women can have a voice in the Senate for years to come?

									Barbara Lee
Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

   Our end of month deadline is Wednesday, January 31st at midnight, and
   here’s what will happen if we hit it:
     * We can ramp up our digital ads and reach voters in every part and
       pocket of the state.
     * We can begin get-out-the-vote efforts, which are critical ahead of
       primaries like ours where turnout tends to be low.
   Here’s what will happen if we don’t hit it:
     * We’ll have to scale back on TV ads (a risky move because our opponent
       is already outspending us every single day).
     * We’ll look weak in our pre-primary fundraising report, and that could
       encourage additional super PAC spending against Katie.
   With just a week until ballots are mailed to voters and 20% of people

Katie is running for the U.S. Senate because Californians deserve a warrior fighting for them in Washington. Our campaign is people-powered, we don’t take a dime from corporate PACs, federal lobbyists, or executives from Big Oil or Big Pharma.

=========================================BREAKING FROM VOX NEWS: The Supreme Court will hear its biggest abortion case since it overturned Roe v. Wade
Jenga: You're one of 1,000 Democrats from your area who have been chosen to participate in our Supreme Court Approval Poll.
The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has caused immense damage to our country – including overturning Roe v. Wade, weakening the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to fight pollution and ending affirmative action in higher education. 
As the Court makes decisions that are totally out of step with public opinion, Americans are turning on them. That's why we're conducting a live approval poll to find out what Americans really think of the Supreme Court.
We're still missing 384 responses from your state – including yours – so we need to hear from you by midnight to ensure we have accurate data. Please, take a second to speak out against the Supreme Court by locking in your response:
Do you approve of the Supreme Court?
YES / NO

BREAKING FROM VOX NEWS: The Supreme Court will hear its biggest abortion case since it overturned Roe v. Wade
Jenga: You're one of 1,000 Democrats from your area who have been chosen to participate in our Supreme Court Approval Poll.
The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has caused immense damage to our country – including overturning Roe v. Wade, weakening the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to fight pollution and ending affirmative action in higher education. 
As the Court makes decisions that are totally out of step with public opinion, Americans are turning on them. That's why we're conducting a live approval poll to find out what Americans really think of the Supreme Court.
We're still missing 384 responses from your state – including yours – so we need to hear from you by midnight to ensure we have accurate data. Please, take a second to speak out against the Supreme Court by locking in your response:
Do you approve of the Supreme Court?
YES
NO
**This live poll is for Jengabuilding90@gmail.com only. Please do not share this link.**
A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw-allred-email-nov-2023?refcode=jtk1343-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Friend, my journey to Congress looks a bit different than most. 
My mom was my biggest hero growing up. She raised me on her own in Dallas, and I spent most afternoons at the local YMCA while she worked a second job to make ends meet. With a lot of hard work and support from my mom, coaches, and teachers, I earned a full football scholarship to Baylor and went on to play in the NFL.
Then, I went to law school, became a civil rights attorney to protect voting rights, and served in the Obama administration.
 I ran for Congress because I don’t want my story to be the exception – I want all kids to have every opportunity to achieve their dreams.
Now, I’m running for Senate because I’m sick and tired of watching Ted Cruz fail Texas kids and families. And experts agree we can win – since launching our campaign, CNN has named Ted Cruz the most vulnerable Republican in the Senate.
It’s going to take the biggest grassroots movement Texas has ever seen, and I need you to be a part of it, friend. So please: Will you chip in any amount today to help me send Ted Cruz packing once and for all? →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

Friend, nothing prepared me for the hollow feeling I woke up with on Nov. 9, 2016 – the day after Donald Trump was elected. 
At the time, I was working in President Obama's administration, and I couldn't believe our country had made so much progress, only to elect someone who wanted to take us backward.
I couldn't help but question if I could have done more – if we all could have done more to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. 
I didn't know it that day, but Trump's election and the dangerous direction he and his far-right supporters took our country in would be one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress.
I couldn't stand what was happening, and I had to do whatever I could to change it. Turns out, a lot of people felt the same way I did – and that's how we defeated a 22-year GOP incumbent and elected me as TX-32’s first ever Democratic Congressman and won back the House for Democrats in 2018.
My motivation remains the same in this race. For the last decade, I've watched Ted Cruz fail Texans time and again. I know I can do better, and I know Texans are ready for change. 
But this race is going to come down to a handful of votes, and Ted Cruz has special interests and mega donors lining his pockets to crush our grassroots movement. He's got over $7.3 MILLION in the bank, and I've got to hit my critical deadlines just to keep up.
I know I don't want to wake up the day after Election Day on Nov. 6th wishing we had done more to defeat Ted Cruz, friend. That's why I have to ask: Will you donate $5, $10, or any amount you can spare to support my campaign? Every dollar brings us that much closer to firing Ted Cruz and bringing real leadership to Texas. →

									I couldn't stand what was happening, and I had to do whatever I could to change it. Turns out, a lot of people felt the same way I did – and that's how we defeated a 22-year GOP incumbent and elected me as TX-32’s first ever Democratic Congressman and won back the House for Democrats in 2018.
My motivation remains the same in this race. For the last decade, I've watched Ted Cruz fail Texans time and again. I know I can do better, and I know Texans are ready for change.
									But this race is going to come down to a handful of votes, and Ted Cruz has special interests and mega donors lining his pockets to crush our grassroots movement. He's got over $7.3 MILLION in the bank, and I've got to hit my critical deadlines just to keep up.
I know I don't want to wake up the day after Election Day on Nov. 6th wishing we had done more to defeat Ted Cruz, friend. That's why I have to ask: Will you donate $5, $10, or any amount you can spare to support my campaign? Every dollar brings us that much closer to firing Ted Cruz and bringing real leadership to Texas. →

No regrets,

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================Friend: Ballots go out to California voters next week – but despite the urgency, I'm not on track to meet my $100,000 end-of-month goal. I truly cannot afford to fall even a penny short, but here's where things stand: 
Friend, as someone who has continuously been ranked as one of the most progressive members of Congress, I can bring about the change that we deserve in the Senate. I can be the additional vote we need to finally abolish the filibuster, address economic injustice and pass crucial legislation like restoring abortion access nationwide. 
But I'm up against opponents who are sitting on MILLIONS, and if I don't get more resources ASAP, they may drown me out. 
Polling shows that as many as 20% of California voters are still undecided just over a month out from election day, so this is truly still anyone's race. That's why I'm focusing all of my efforts on expanding my voter outreach efforts on the ground. 
But if I miss this fundraising goal – my FINAL end-of-month deadline before ballots go out – I'll have to make tough decisions, like pulling back our efforts to reach California voters. 
Friend, this close to election day, every choice we each make is incredibly impactful. It could be your $5 donation that helps us knock on just enough doors, call just enough voters or run just enough ads to push this campaign – and our movement – across the finish line.
Please, will you rush $5 or more right now to help me reach enough voters and build a progressive future for all of us?

   Here are three reasons why you should donate today:
   1. Our opponent, David McCormick, cut himself a check for $1 million last
   quarter — and that kind of self-funding is a major advantage. We have to
   fight back, and that starts with staying on track with our fundraising.
   2.The polls are getting tighter, making this race even more competitive.
   3. November will be here before we know it. By working hard now, we will
   be able to keep up our momentum through Election Day.

=========================================I wanted to take some time today to let you know how much your support means to me. I hope you will read until the end, but if you’re short on time, could I ask you to chip in $15 before you log off to help me unseat Kevin Cramer, compete with Republicans’ special interest cash, and win this Senate seat? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240206_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]
I had to reach out to thank you for all the support you’ve given me so far.
I truly would not be where I am today without you.
Together, we are building an unstoppable grassroots movement that will help Democrats hold the Senate Majority.
I can feel the energy and excitement wherever I go. I know you feel it, too.
Something is happening in North Dakota that can’t be stopped.
All across North Dakota, people are pitching in wherever they can. So many of you are making donations, talking to your friends and neighbors, and even volunteering to lend a hand with our campaign.
I’ve already received donations from more than 3,300 people all across the country.
And I’m incredibly proud that our movement has an average grassroots online donation of just $37.65.
We are building unbeatable momentum powered by everyday folks.
Fundraising is easy when you accept dark money and donations from special interests like Kevin Cramer does. But I’m not taking a dime of Corporate PAC money, because I’m running to represent people like you.
Even though we have to work harder, I’m so proud that my founding donors are:
– Teachers who want to ensure that every child receives high-quality education
– Small business owners who want to grow the economy
– Parents and grandparents who want to build a better future for generations to come
...and there's still time for you to join them.
Will you chip in any amount and become a Founding Donor of my campaign? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240206_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]

I’m working hard to build a campaign we can be proud of, and I know we will win with your help.
I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for everyday Americans to make sure our needs are put above political games.
If you’re reading this email, I bet you’ll agree that we’re at a pivotal moment in the race for the Senate Majority.
We need a leader who’s ready to solve problems, fight for regular folks, and make sure everyone has access to quality and affordable healthcare.
I will be that leader. Unlike my opponent who consistently takes money from special interest donors and votes against the interest of working and middle-class families.
I’m running for Senate to serve you and your families.
We have an unprecedented shot to win this thing, but this race is going to be extremely competitive – and expensive – and I can’t win without your help.
Can you pitch in any amount before midnight so that my campaign can stand up to Kevin Cramer’s special interest cash? I can’t tell you how much it would mean to me. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240206_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

I wanted to take some time today to let you know how much your support means to me. I hope you will read until the end, but if you’re short on time, could I ask you to chip in $15 before you log off to help me unseat Kevin Cramer, compete with Republicans’ special interest cash, and win this Senate seat? >>
I had to reach out to thank you for all the support you’ve given me so far.
I truly would not be where I am today without you.
Together, we are building an unstoppable grassroots movement that will help Democrats hold the Senate Majority.
I can feel the energy and excitement wherever I go. I know you feel it, too.
Something is happening in North Dakota that can’t be stopped.
All across North Dakota, people are pitching in wherever they can. So many of you are making donations, talking to your friends and neighbors, and even volunteering to lend a hand with our campaign.
I’ve already received donations from more than 3,300 people all across the country.
And I’m incredibly proud that our movement has an average grassroots online donation of just $37.65.
We are building unbeatable momentum powered by everyday folks.
Fundraising is easy when you accept dark money and donations from special interests like Kevin Cramer does. But I’m not taking a dime of Corporate PAC money, because I’m running to represent people like you. 
Even though we have to work harder, I’m so proud that my founding donors are:
– Teachers who want to ensure that every child receives high-quality education
– Small business owners who want to grow the economy
– Parents and grandparents who want to build a better future for generations to come
...and there's still time for you to join them.
Will you chip in any amount and become a Founding Donor of my campaign? >> 
FOR: Jengabuilding90@gmail.com
Suggested Support $15 >>
I’m working hard to build a campaign we can be proud of, and I know we will win with your help.
I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for everyday Americans to make sure our needs are put above political games.
If you’re reading this email, I bet you’ll agree that we’re at a pivotal moment in the race for the Senate Majority.
We need a leader who’s ready to solve problems, fight for regular folks, and make sure everyone has access to quality and affordable healthcare.
I will be that leader. Unlike my opponent who consistently takes money from special interest donors and votes against the interest of working and middle-class families.
I’m running for Senate to serve you and your families.
We have an unprecedented shot to win this thing, but this race is going to be extremely competitive – and expensive – and I can’t win without your help. 
Can you pitch in any amount before midnight so that my campaign can stand up to Kevin Cramer’s special interest cash? I can’t tell you how much it would mean to me. >>
Chip in $15 now >>

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
						Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

Hi friend, I’m writing to you today about history in the making. My friend Lisa Blunt Rochester is on the cusp of becoming the first woman and Black U.S. Senator from Delaware, but she can't do it without our help.
I'd like to tell you more about her, but if you don't have time, all I ask is that you chip in whatever you can swing today. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.02.03_B1_Barnes-30op]

To say Lisa is the right person for the job would be an understatement.
She has a proven track record of fighting for reproductive freedom, voting rights, and affordable housing as Delaware’s Congresswoman for the past 6 years. And she's always brought all Delawareans' voices to the table.
Lisa has also shown us what it means to fight the good fight in the era of MAGA extremism. She's stood arm-in-arm with vulnerable communities across her state in defiance of hatred and bigotry.
If it isn't yet obvious, we need Lisa Blunt Rochester in the Senate.
But, here's the catch: Lisa's Republican opponents are working hard to stop her campaign from keeping this seat blue. Losing Delaware would be crushing for our Senate Majority – we can't let that happen.
Whether it's $5 or $25, please rush any amount to help Lisa Blunt Rochester win her historic race for Senate. Let's give little Black girls another role model to look to in government. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.02.03_B1_Barnes-30op]

   Jenga,
   I wanted you to hear it from me directly: I’m running to represent
   California in the U.S. Senate in 2024. We’ve made a lot of progress the
   past two years, but the American people have made it clear that we should
   be doing even more.
   We took on big polluters to make the largest climate investment in our
   nation’s history.
   We took on the NRA to pass the first federal gun safety legislation in
   three decades.
   We took on Big Pharma to cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs by
   letting Medicare negotiate directly with the drug companies.
   We made a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure, green
   jobs and 21st-century manufacturing with the Infrastructure and Jobs Act
   and the CHIPS and Science Act.
   But the filibuster is intact. Roe v. Wade has been overturned. And now
   that GOP legislatures have gerrymandered away the Democratic House
   majority, it’s clear that the fight for the future of our democracy will
   happen within the Senate.
   We must press on to continue the hard work of repairing the damage Trump
   and MAGA Republicans have done to our nation and its institutions — while
   defending against their continued attempts to propagate the Big Lie and
   undermine the right to vote.
   We must do so in the context of another Trump presidential campaign
   already in full swing.
   There are so many important priorities right now, and I want to know where
   you think I should focus my efforts as we build this Senate campaign.

Thanks for all you have already done to help us make this historic progress — and I look forward to fighting alongside you in the important work still to come.
Thanks so much. It means a lot.

   Maryland. Thank you to everyone who came out to support our campaign. Take
   a look below for some highlights from the campaign trail and beyond!
                        THIS WEEK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
   We were up bright and early, for a great coffee meeting with folks in
   Annapolis, where we discussed health care, reproductive rights, affordable
   housing, and so many other important issues for Marylanders.
   Thank you to Annapolis’ Eastport Democratic Club for inviting us to join
   for a tasty breakfast, some much needed coffee, and a great conversation!

=========================================I know you're probably busy, so I'll get right to it:
I'm in a dead heat with my opponents in Ohio's Senate race, and I can only surge ahead if I reach my $50,000 fundraising goal before our midnight deadline. So please, is there anything I can say to convince you to split $10 between my campaign and Maria Cantwell’s to defend our Democratic majority in the Senate? [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc-brown?amount=10]
Would it make a difference if I told you that Mitch McConnell is coming after me as a top target to flip the Senate red?
What if I told you that my three GOP opponents are millionaires who can self-fund their campaigns – and one of them just spent $2 million to flood the airwaves with TV ads in Ohio?
And, what if I told you that with polls showing me neck and neck with my opponents, we're still falling short of our midnight goal with just hours until the deadline?

   Jenga, I have
   some extraordinary, breaking news to share with you:
   California’s iconic U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer JUST endorsed our campaign
   for U.S. Senate.
   Senator Boxer was a trailblazer in the U.S. Senate. She was a champion for
   reproductive rights and a fierce defender of our public lands.
   For decades, she delivered results for California — and she became a
   mentor and friend to me. Her endorsement means the world.

   support means the world to me too. Can I count on you to pitch in
   $10 to
   help us let people know of this pivotal endorsement, build on our
   momentum, and finish strong through the final weeks of this March 5 U.S.
   Senate primary?

Jenga, I have some extraordinary, breaking news to share with you:
California’s iconic U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer JUST endorsed our campaign for U.S. Senate.
Senator Boxer was a trailblazer in the U.S. Senate. She was a champion for reproductive rights and a fierce defender of our public lands.
For decades, she delivered results for California — and she became a mentor and friend to me. Her endorsement means the world.
Jenga, your support means the world to me too. Can I count on you to pitch in $10 to help us let people know of this pivotal endorsement, build on our momentum, and finish strong through the final weeks of this March 5 U.S. Senate primary?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
EXPRESS DONATE $10
EXPRESS DONATE $25
EXPRESS DONATE $50
EXPRESS DONATE $100

ANOTHER AMOUNT
I’m truly humbled to have Sen. Boxer’s support, and I can’t wait to build on her long legacy of getting things done for the Golden State in the U.S. Senate.
And I couldn’t be more proud to have a grassroots team like this one to help us get there.
Thank you.
— Adam

=========================================                         [1]Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate
   Jenga — I’m running to defeat Josh
   Hawley and take Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat back for working people.
   Here’s what I want to accomplish once I get there:
   Putting people in charge of their own lives: Politicians like Josh Hawley
   are obsessed with controlling every aspect of our lives. I’m committed to
   restoring abortion access and protecting reproductive freedom in all 50
   states by ending the filibuster and codifying Roe v. Wade — finally giving
   people the power to make decisions about their own bodies, families, and
   economic opportunities.
   Holding politicians + corporate elites accountable: Too many of our
   leaders have been bought off by the massive corporations responsible for
   stripping our communities for parts. That’s why I’m fighting to ban
   insider trading for members of Congress and abolish ALL corporate PAC
   donations to campaigns — and it’s why I’m holding myself and my campaign
   to that same standard.
   Showing up for working Missourians: Real workers are tired of corporate
   elites and frauds writing the rules we all have to live by. I’ll always
   stand on the side of working people by continuing to fight for the right
   to organize and pushing back against anti-union “Right-to-Work” scams in
   Missouri + all across the country.
   A Marshall Plan for the Midwest: DC politicians spent decades wasting
   trillions of dollars on corporate handouts and forever wars. Now, it’s
   time to invest in the workers and communities that make our country strong
   so we can rebuild our forgotten towns and finally start making stuff in
   America again.
   I’m ready to represent Missouri and stand up for everyday people in the
   U.S. Senate — but I need your help to get there.

   What if we told you that recent approval ratings from Morning Consult
   confirmed that Josh Hawley remains the most vulnerable GOP Senator up for
   re-election in 2024 — and that multiple recent polls show he’s in a
   margin-of-error race with Lucas Kunce for Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat?
   Or what if we said shady insiders and corporate mega-donors are already
   spending MILLIONS to keep their grip on this seat by dumping money into
   Super PACs and Josh Hawley’s campaign, all so they can fund desperate
   attacks on Lucas and preserve their corrupt status quo?
   Or what if we told you that we’re just hours away from our first
   fundraising deadline of 2024 — and that we’re just $1,500 away from
   hitting our January end-of-month goal?
   How we start this year will have a major impact on our campaign’s ability
   to fight back and win in November — so supporting Lucas and our race here
   in Missouri right now could be your chance to make a real difference.
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43280?refcode=em20240131-4725&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4725%2E1040133%2EGBl6dX Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]So
   Jenga,
   can you add your
   first donation of absolutely any amount toward our goal of

Jenga,
Is there anything we can say to encourage you to add your first donation of any amount toward our goal of raising $400,000 before midnight TONIGHT?
DEFEAT JOSH HAWLEY: CHIP IN NOW →
What if we told you that recent approval ratings from Morning Consult confirmed that Josh Hawley remains the most vulnerable GOP Senator up for re-election in 2024 — and that multiple recent polls show he’s in a margin-of-error race with Lucas Kunce for Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat?
Or what if we said shady insiders and corporate mega-donors are already spending MILLIONS to keep their grip on this seat by dumping money into Super PACs and Josh Hawley’s campaign, all so they can fund desperate attacks on Lucas and preserve their corrupt status quo?
Or what if we told you that we’re just hours away from our first fundraising deadline of 2024 — and that we’re just $1,500 away from hitting our January end-of-month goal?
How we start this year will have a major impact on our campaign’s ability to fight back and win in November — so supporting Lucas and our race here in Missouri right now could be your chance to make a real difference.
So Jenga, can you add your first donation of absolutely any amount toward our goal of raising $400,000 online before midnight tonight? Lucas isn’t taking a cent from corporate PACs in this race, so your support really does power our grassroots campaign.

   Uh-oh, Jenga…
   Our first end-of-month deadline of 2024 is tomorrow, and we have some bad
   news to share: We made a mistake.
   We really thought that our grassroots fundraising goal was within reach,

=========================================Hi Jenga, it's Carole King. 
My friend Sherrod Brown is facing a tough reelection, and he needs ALL of us to pitch in. YOU have grassroots power, and together, we ARE grassroots power. 
Will you join me in supporting Senator Brown with a donation of $5, or whatever you can afford?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1140-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
Here’s why Sherrod is worthy of your support. 
When I was growing up, my mom taught speech in public school, and my dad was a firefighter. They taught me the value of hard work, and most importantly, the dignity of work. Today, I’m still a proud member of three unions. 
I’m inspired by Sherrod’s campaign because he's a proven champion for workers' rights. He’s spent his life in the trenches advocating for everything from higher wages to the right to unionize.
And Sherrod has always been a fearless leader at the forefront of protecting civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights, and reproductive rights. 
Sherrod will always stand up for working families like the one in which I grew up. That’s why I’m asking you to use your grassroots power to make sure that a significant majority of Buckeye Staters turn out and vote to keep him in the U.S. Senate.
Will you donate right now to keep our “dignity of work” champion Sherrod Brown in the U.S. Senate?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1140-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
Sherrod has run on these issues and won elections in the past, but Ohio has become increasingly challenging for a Democrat to win statewide. Sherrod is one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection – and Ohio’s race for his seat could decide Senate control. 
Jenga, with Republicans getting millions of dollars from billionaires who pay less in taxes than American workers do, grassroots power is the most effective way to keep Sherrod Brown as our champion in the Senate and ensure that our hopes, our dreams, and our rights are the law of the land. 
So please, will you join me RIGHT NOW in chipping in $5, or whatever you can afford, to reelect Sherrod in Ohio so he can continue fighting for working families across the country?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1140-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5

   First off,
   thanks so much to this team for helping us hit our January fundraising
   goal. Unfortunately, we got some disappointing news this morning that I
   need to share:
    1. Adam Schiff is running TV ads to *boost* our Republican opponent,
       Steve Garvey. Running an ad that highlights another candidate in a way
       that boosts their credibility with a certain sect of voters is a way
       politicians try to game the system to get an opponent they have the
       best chance of defeating.
       Adam Schiff is doing this because he knows he will lose to us in
       November if we beat Steve Garvey and advance to the general election.
       That's what this brazenly cynical ad is about—furthering Adam’s own
       political career, boxing out qualified Democratic women candidates,
       and boosting a Republican candidate to do it. We need honest
       leadership, not political games.
    2. A new USC poll released today, conducted right after last week’s
       debate, showed us completely tied with Steve Garvey for second place.
       Even after Steve Garvey’s refusal to take a single solid policy
       position in the debate, we’re still in a dead heat.
   To make it
   to the general election, we just need to place second in the primary, but
   today’s news shows we’re at real risk of coming in third. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240201-1?refcode=em20240201-37192&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37192_10298894_3jGsp5&akid=37192%2E10298894%2E3jGsp5 ]Is there
   anything you can give right now to help us ramp up our ads and reach the
   voters who will decide this race?

   This is going to be an incredibly close race, and every dollar counts.

First off, thanks so much to this team for helping us hit our January fundraising goal. Unfortunately, we got some disappointing news this morning that I need to share:
Adam Schiff is running TV ads to *boost* our Republican opponent, Steve Garvey. Running an ad that highlights another candidate in a way that boosts their credibility with a certain sect of voters is a way politicians try to game the system to get an opponent they have the best chance of defeating.  Adam Schiff is doing this because he knows he will lose to us in November if we beat Steve Garvey and advance to the general election. That's what this brazenly cynical ad is about—furthering Adam’s own political career, boxing out qualified Democratic women candidates, and boosting a Republican candidate to do it. We need honest leadership, not political games.
A new USC poll released today, conducted right after last week’s debate, showed us completely tied with Steve Garvey for second place. Even after Steve Garvey’s refusal to take a single solid policy position in the debate, we’re still in a dead heat.
To make it to the general election, we just need to place second in the primary, but today’s news shows we’re at real risk of coming in third. Is there anything you can give right now to help us ramp up our ads and reach the voters who will decide this race?

This is going to be an incredibly close race, and every dollar counts. Thanks a ton.

   This doesn’t come as a surprise — Republicans have made it clear that
   Tammy is one of their top targets to defeat.
   It’s why they’ve recruited California bank owner Eric Hovde to run against
   her — a megamillionaire who is willing to spend at least $20 million of
   his own personal fortune to flip Wisconsin’s Senate seat.
   The attacks won’t stop once Hovde enters the race and Republicans work
   tirelessly to flip the one seat they need to win back the Senate majority.

It’s why they’ve recruited California bank owner Eric Hovde to run against her — a megamillionaire who is willing to spend at least $20 million of his own personal fortune to flip Wisconsin’s Senate seat.
The attacks won’t stop once Hovde enters the race and Republicans work tirelessly to flip the one seat they need to win back the Senate majority.
So as we’re facing our first deadline of 2024, we’re turning to you:
Will you defend Tammy against these latest attack ads by rushing in a donation? Our first end-of-month deadline of the year is less than 72 hours away and now’s the time to fight back.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
CHIP IN $5 NOW
CHIP IN $10 NOW
CHIP IN $25 NOW
CHIP IN $50 NOW
CHIP IN $100 NOW

Thanks for having Tammy’s back.

Jenga ,
It’s April Cao.
When my husband Hung decided to run for the U.S. Senate, it wasn’t a solo 
decision. It was something we prayed about as a family, because we knew 
whatever came our way, we’d have to work as a team.
 Now, I’m so excited for what’s to come this year, and I’m so excited to be 
working with patriots like you to send my husband to the U.S. Senate.
But if we’re going to win, we have to get down to business.
We’ve set an ambitious $10K Donor Drive Goal for midnight tonight, and right 
now, we’re about halfway there.
Please, will you pitch in now to send this American hero to the U.S. Senate 
and help us meet our goal? 
<https://secure.winred.com/hung-cao-for-virginia/10k-donor-drive>
HELP US MEET OUR GOAL 
<https://secure.winred.com/hung-cao-for-virginia/10k-donor-drive>
Hung shows up in every aspect of his life, whether it’s for me, our children, 
or this campaign.
I married him because I knew he was kind, hardworking, loyal, and shared the 
same values that I do.
 Standing by him at every phase in his life, from his 25-year Naval career to 
the campaign, has been an honor.
Now, I hope that you’ll stand with us, but time is running out to meet this 
critical goal.
 Pitch in ASAP so we can meet our $10K goal by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT and help us 
start off this year strong!

I wouldn’t be reaching out to you if it wasn’t 100% necessary, Jenga , but 
these goals are important.

Jenga, 
The Border crisis  rages. Yet D.C. politicians are dead-set on partnering with 
Democrats to hand-deliver a huge victory to Joe Biden. All at the expense of 
the American people.What could go wrong...
WATCH THE FOX NEWS CLIP ⬇︎⬇︎⬇︎
 <https://secure.winred.com/josh-hawley-committee/hawley-border>
The catastrophe at the border is a crisis of Joe Biden's own making, with a 
well-documented trail of drugs, deaths, human trafficking, and more left in the 
wake. Biden wants money for his proxy war in Ukraine, more green cards, and 
benefits to illegal immigrants already here, all while keeping the border WIDE 
OPEN.
Only Democrats and politicians could think that a lifetime in D.C. is worth 
more than boots-on-the-ground experience at the Southern Border. It's 
hypocritical and wrong!
HELP FUND THE FIGHT!

=========================================Friend, California deserves a TRUE progressive – and that's why I'm proud to be ranked "the most liberal member" of the House of Representatives. If you would like to help send me – a true battle-tested progressive – to the Senate, click here to rush a donation to my campaign.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1000-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Listen, I didn't become the most liberal member of the House overnight. This title required years of supporting progressive causes and never once wavering from them – even in the face of death threats. 
I was the only person in Congress to vote against the 60-word resolution that gave President George W. Bush nearly unlimited war powers in the days following 9/11.
I've been an unwavering leader in the fight to make the rich pay their fair share – and have introduced legislation with Sen. Bernie Sanders to tax Wall Street.
I've played a key role in passing the expanded Child Tax Credit – which reduced child poverty by 46%.
I've spent years fighting for Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, debt-free college, the expansion of critical safety net programs and ending the racist war on drugs – and have served on several committees to work toward these goals. 
Friend, I'm honored to be ranked the most liberal member of the House – but now, I've set my sights on taking my progressive agenda to the Senate.
If you help me get to the Senate, you can rest assured that I will always be at the forefront of the fight for progress – just as I have been for decades in the House. So I have to ask, as this is shaping up to be the most competitive Senate races in history:
Will you donate any amount you can spare to my campaign and help me build a progressive future for all?

   $5, Jenga. 
   That’s what I’m asking you to contribute to my re-election campaign to
   defend Pennsylvania’s critical seat and stop the GOP from taking the
   Senate.
   $5 might not seem like much, but when everyone chips in, we can build a
   winning campaign in a critical Senate battleground. 
   $5 today is what we need to go up against our mega-millionaire Republican
   opponent and a dark money GOP PAC supporting him that has already amassed
   a record-breaking amount — over $18 million — to spend against us.

   Please, Jenga, 
   will you donate $5 right now? I need your help to build the strongest
   possible defense to keep Pennsylvania blue.
   Pennsylvania is going to be key in Democrats’ fight to defend our
   razor-thin Senate majority and the White House in 2024. We need all the
   support we can get to make that happen.
   November will be here before we know it. The $5 donations that we raise
   now will determine what happens to Pennsylvania — and our Nation — then.

=========================================It's official, Jenga: After CNN named me one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, my GOP opponents started outspending me on the airwaves to flip this seat. Even worse, as of 3 p.m., I'm falling short of the $250,000 I need to raise by tonight's end-of-month deadline to fight back.
With Senate control on the line, I don't have anywhere else to turn, Jenga. That's why I had my team check your record, and it looks like you haven't made your first gift yet..
So please, will you donate through this personalized link to help us win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue?

It's official, Jenga: After CNN named me one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, my GOP opponents started outspending me on the airwaves to flip this seat. Even worse, as of 3 p.m., I'm falling short of the $250,000 I need to raise by tonight's end-of-month deadline to fight back.
With Senate control on the line, I don't have anywhere else to turn, Jenga. That's why I had my team check your record, and it looks like you haven't made your first gift yet.
So please, will you donate through this personalized link to help us win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue?https://sherrodbrown.com/donate/January-deadline/Jengabuiling90@gmail.com
Thank you in advance, Jenga.

=========================================   Hi Jenga, it’s
   Governor Josh Shapiro.
   There’s no doubt in my mind that 2024 will be as historic an election year
   as 2022 was for Pennsylvania. In 2022, we won the Governor’s race, elected
   John Fetterman to the Senate, and ensured that fundamental freedoms would
   be protected in our Commonwealth.
   This year, the stakes are even higher. Extremist Republicans have their
   sights set on my friend Bob Casey, so I’m reaching out to see if you’ll be
   one of the 2024 founding donors his Senate campaign needs today.

Friend, I have an important update on the state of our race, so I wanted to
personally reach out:
*FIRST, *my opponents spent all of 2023 raking in huge sums of special
interest cash.
*BUT THEN, *I was the top vote-getter at the California Democratic Party
Endorsement Convention.
*NOW,* with TEN days to go before ballots drop, the latest polls show 20%
of California voters are still undecided and our work to get out the vote
has never been more important.
Here's the thing: As a Black woman, I knew I would never raise the most in
this race – because on average, Black female candidates raise just a
fraction of what white candidates do. But, I don't need to raise the most;
I just need to raise *enough* to reach the right voters.
*And if we do that, we will pull ahead – because the polls have made it
clear that the more voters learn about me, the more I earn their support.
That's why we plan to put every last resource toward expanding our voter
outreach – and I'm counting on you to help fund these efforts.*
*Friend, will you rush $5 or more right now to help me close the gap in the
polls and build a progressive future for all of us?

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next
Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to
ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling
the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25
years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being
outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across
the state. *Because with recent polling showing that a large number of
California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more
into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.*

Friend, I have an important update on the state of our race, so I wanted to personally reach out:
FIRST, my opponents spent all of 2023 raking in huge sums of special interest cash.
BUT THEN, I was the top vote-getter at the California Democratic Party Endorsement Convention.
NOW, with TEN days to go before ballots drop, the latest polls show 20% of California voters are still undecided and our work to get out the vote has never been more important.
Here's the thing: As a Black woman, I knew I would never raise the most in this race – because on average, Black female candidates raise just a fraction of what white candidates do. But, I don't need to raise the most; I just need to raise enough to reach the right voters. 
And if we do that, we will pull ahead – because the polls have made it clear that the more voters learn about me, the more I earn their support. That's why we plan to put every last resource toward expanding our voter outreach – and I'm counting on you to help fund these efforts.
Friend, will you rush $5 or more right now to help me close the gap in the polls and build a progressive future for all of us?

=========================================I needed to share this update with you directly, Jenga: A self-funding GOP millionaire – and one of Donald Trump's yes-men – is running against me for Ohio's Senate seat.
With national Republicans prepared to spend millions on this race and my opponent just raising nearly $350,000 at a massive fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, I need your immediate grassroots support to fight back ASAP. So I'm personally asking: Will you chip in right now so we can win and keep the Senate blue?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1158-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,10&recurring=1
Here's why this is so important: With experts saying that Ohio could decide Senate control, Washington Republicans are doing everything in their power to defeat me and flip the Senate red. The truth is, I'm not scared. But I do know that where Trump goes, GOP dark money follows. That's why I'm personally reaching out to ask for your help.
Unlike my potential opponent, I don’t have a massive personal fortune to pour into this race. Instead, I'm relying on critical support from folks like you, one grassroots donation at a time. So please, will you chip in $5 or more now before our end-of-month deadline to help us win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue? 
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1158-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,10&recurring=1

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.

=========================================Friend – I don’t like reaching out like this, but what would you do in my situation?
Right now, I’m the most vulnerable woman in the Senate, and experts predict that Nevada could deliver both the White House AND the Senate to Republicans this year.
Chip in to keep Nevada blue and defend our Democratic majority!
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_january_2024?refcode=jtk3383-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
With so much riding on my critical battleground race in Nevada and polling showing me neck and neck with my GOP opponent, I have no choice but to call on top supporters like you for help.
Let me be clear: Missing any of my fundraising deadlines at this stage could cause irreversible damage to my campaign’s momentum. And right now, there are just hours left to make up a $2,970 gap on our critical $100,000 end-of-month goal before our midnight fundraising deadline.
Please, friend, we can’t just stand by and let Republicans pour money into Nevada until it flips red: Will you chip in $5 – or as much as you can spare today – to help me fight back and keep Nevada and our Senate blue?

Friend – I don’t like reaching out like this, but what would you do in my situation?
Right now, I’m the most vulnerable woman in the Senate, and experts predict that Nevada could deliver both the White House AND the Senate to Republicans this year.
With so much riding on my critical battleground race in Nevada and polling showing me neck and neck with my GOP opponent, I have no choice but to call on top supporters like you for help.
Let me be clear: Missing any of my fundraising deadlines at this stage could cause irreversible damage to my campaign’s momentum. And right now, there are just hours left to make up a $2,970 gap on our critical $100,000 end-of-month goal before our midnight fundraising deadline.
Please, friend, we can’t just stand by and let Republicans pour money into Nevada until it flips red: Will you chip in $5 – or as much as you can spare today – to help me fight back and keep Nevada and our Senate blue?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Thank you for staying with me in this fight. I know we can win this.

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

Fellow Conservative,
I’m running for U.S. Senate in Nevada to be your America First voice in Washington.  
Twice endorsed by President Trump in previous races, I’m the REAL conservative in this Republican primary.  
Unlike Sam Brown, who just cares about being a Senator, I care deeply about Nevadans like you and understand how much Joe Biden’s destructive agenda has impacted your daily life.  
>From open borders to rising crime to the worst inflation crisis in decades, our country is in DEEP TROUBLE. And we can’t afford another four years of far-left insanity in Washington.  
If you want a Senator who will fight night and day to save America from the woke mob and make our country great again, will you please pitch in a generous contribution to support my campaign?  
It is crucial that we stop RINOs from sneaking in and ruining our chances to fully reverse Joe Biden’s agenda this November. And in Nevada the RINOs have a big headstart.  
Donate here to stand with the REAL conservative in Nevada’s Republican Primary for U.S. Senate >> <https://secure.winred.com/jim-marchant-for-us-senate/pg_rs-e_ae-general-intro-to-marchant-bew_20240130_?exitintent=true&utm_source=RevShare&utm_campaign=MarchantJ_AE-General-Intro-to-Marchant_20240130&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=AE-General-Intro-to-Marchant&utm_agency=PG&amount=50>  
As a business founder and a former state legislator who has served our state for years, I know firsthand the challenges Nevadans face every day. And I will do everything in my power to secure our southern border, curb inflationary spending, and finally get our economy back on track.  
I will be proud to serve as your conservative warrior in the U.S. Senate, taking the fight to big government bureaucrats, Big Tech elitists, and woke radicals who want to destroy America as we know it.  
But the only way I can secure victory is with YOUR support.

=========================================It didn’t take long, team: Tammy had barely launched her campaign before the attacks began pouring in. They’re attacks most men will never deal with, but they’re all too familiar to many women.
Men in the media are implying that Tammy’s work to solve New Jersey’s maternal and infant mortality crisis — work that addressed systemic racism, improved NJ’s national ranking for maternal deaths from 47th to 27th, and ultimately saved lives — is overblown and unimportant.
Opponents are claiming outright that Tammy’s not ready for this fight, despite six years of statewide leadership and her long track record of accomplishments.
And nearly everywhere she goes, Tammy’s held to a higher standard and faces tougher questions than most men. ("I'm not sure a male would be asked this question," she recently fired back.)
But Tammy isn’t backing down, and neither are we. Tammy has spent much of her life as the only woman in rooms filled with powerful men, and she’s made a difference every time.
If you’re ready to elect Tammy as the first woman Senator in New Jersey’s history, please chip in today to reach our first monthly fundraising goal. We’re about 72 donations short with three days until our deadline.

=========================================   A fresh poll just leaked in Arizona. 
It’s bad news for Ruben. 
Kari Lake: 46% (+2)
Ruben Gallego: 44%
Every poll released over the last few months has had one thing in common: Kari Lake is leading Ruben in Arizona. 
We have to take this seriously because if we don’t take the lead in Arizona it could be a complete disaster for our chances at holding the Senate. 
We need you to rush $5 to Ruben Gallego right now to help us take back the lead. Our majority in the Senate is at extreme risk if these polls are right.

   reporting shows that Kyrsten Sinema spent more than $200,000 of taxpayer
   money on private flights.
   It isn’t standard practice for lawmakers to take private jets using
   government funds. Each Member of Congress is allotted an office budget,
   which we normally use to pay for staff who serve constituents, events like
   town halls, and commercial flights to get ourselves from our homestates to
   DC.
   This type of taxpayer dollar abuse is unacceptable.
   I’ve introduced legislation to boost accountability and inform the public
   about when, where, and how Members of Congress travel on the taxpayers’
   dime. [ https://act.katieporter.com/signup/kp4s-em-transparency/?source==em20240203-37188&t=1002&akid=37188%2E10298894%2EYyC5Jr ]Can you sign my petition to show your support for this bill?

   Stories like this fuel Americans' distrust in our government, and people
   are right to be concerned. Too many politicians allocate money to pet
   projects, take marching orders from corporations, and slip loopholes into
   bills on behalf of their biggest donors.
   I was shocked by the amount of legalized corruption I saw when I first got
   to Congress in 2019, and since then, I’ve made cleaning this place up one
   of my top priorities. Now, I’m the only person in this race who supports
   banning corporate PAC and federal lobbyist money, and doing away with
   earmarks—which lead to waste and fraud.
   I’m proud to run a people-powered campaign as we fight to clean up
   corruption and shake up the status quo. Anything you can give today will
   help me hold power to account.

=========================================Jenga, we hit our very first goal of 2024 Wednesday night, and
   all I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you!
   I can hardly believe it’s been less than a year since we launched this
   Senate campaign. 365 days ago, I couldn’t have imagined a team even half
   as generous or strong as this one. So far, you’ve truly gone above and
   beyond.
   But this race is heating up as the May 14th Democratic Primary gets
   closer. We have exactly 102 days to prepare – but I know I can count on
   your support every step of the way. For that, I’m incredibly grateful,
   Jenga.

=========================================Jenga, I'm about to ask you to help me hit my $100,000 weekly goal. But first, I want to tell you a story about doughnuts — and how they're going to help us save our Senate majority. 
here
(If you're short on time and ready to retire Rick Scott this fall, you can help me make up this fundraising gap and flip Florida blue by clicking here to split a gift between Kirsten Gillibrand and my campaign.)
When I was 14, my family came to America to seek a better life. We arrived here with big dreams for the future. But those early days were hard. I remember my mom working back-to-back double shifts and still struggling to afford rent for our small, one room apartment. 
So, after I turned 15, I got a job working the early morning shift at a local doughnut shop. It was just a minimum wage job, but the small checks I brought home gave my family room to breathe. Finally, after a lot of hard work, the possibilities that we could only dream of before became reality.
We were able to move out of that one room apartment, and I got a scholarship to an incredible college. Eventually, I found a career path where I could give back to the communities and country that gave me so much. That call to service took me to places I had never even dreamed of before. I became the first South American immigrant to serve in Congress, and now, I'm running for the United States Senate.
Making doughnuts in the morning before homeroom brought me all the way to Congress. I've seen time and time again how small acts have the power to create big, transformative change. And that's exactly how we're going to win this campaign this November.
That's why I'm asking you to chip in just $10 — about the cost of a dozen doughnuts — to send me to the Senate. Can you split a donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand before my weekly deadline to help me defeat Rick Scott? This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations, and every single gift makes a difference.

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Jenga, I know your inbox is probably flooded with messages like this right now — so I’ll keep this brief.                                                                                                                                                                   
Our very first monthly fundraising deadline of the year is in just six hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
But Olac, my finance director, just told me that as of 4:00 pm, we’re still coming up $1,400 short of our can’t-miss goal.                                                                                                                                                                      
Let me be clear, Jenga: We can’t afford to fall short right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Ted Cruz is banking on his mega donors and special interest backers to buy him another term in the Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                      
And if he sees that we missed our first big test of the election year, he’ll take it as a sign that he has this race locked up.                                                                                                                                                                 
I know we have what it takes to win — but we need to stand together at pivotal moments like this.

						Our very first monthly fundraising deadline of the year is in just six hours.
						But Olac, my finance director, just told me that as of 4:00 pm, we’re still coming up $1,400 short of our can’t-miss goal.

						Ted Cruz is banking on his mega donors and special interest backers to buy him another term in the Senate.

=========================================Friend, I'm running to defeat Ted Cruz and become the first ever Black Senator from Texas. If you're already with me, will you make a donation to help power my grassroots campaign? →

All the way back in 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels, a pastor and State Senator from Mississippi, was elected as the first Black U.S. Senator. Since then, we've come a long way as a country. But representation – like our democracy – is a work in progress, and I believe we can do better.
Black Americans have long faced far too many obstacles like: discrimination, lower pay, higher job instability – not to mention the racist voter suppression laws that Texas Republicans like Ted Cruz have championed, which make it harder for certain folks to vote. 
The bottom line is this: It's essential that our government reflects the people it represents.
I'm ready to defeat Ted Cruz this November and fight to build a more perfect union for my boys and every kid in Texas. But unlike Ted Cruz, I don't have corporate special interests footing the bill for my campaign. 
To win, I need a massive movement of grassroots supporters to step up and join me in this fight. Please, will you chip in $5 to power my campaign to defeat Ted Cruz, become the first Black Senator from Texas, and be the leader Texans deserve? →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

   Hi Jenga, Tammy here with an update from the campaign trail!
   Last month, I joined state Democratic leaders for a roundtable discussion
   on abortion rights and reproductive health care ahead of this year’s
   pivotal elections.
   [ https://act.tammybaldwin.com/go/2155?c0=tbe-em-feb24.S4bXxm&refcode=AU_STB_FR_GEN_GEN_AC_20240203_AM1_V1_S1&t=1004&akid=1952%2E1295058%2E96Z7N- ]Tammy Baldwin at a roundtable on abortion rights and reproductive
   health
   We met just before what would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v.
   Wade — had the Supreme Court’s right-wing majority not overturned the
   landmark decision guaranteeing abortion access over a year ago.
   Since that decision, I've been heartened by seeing how many people are
   getting involved around this issue and other freedoms and rights that have
   been taken away.
   Wisconsinites have made it clear how they feel about restoring and
   protecting reproductive rights — we proved it by electing Justice Janet
   Protasiewicz to the state Supreme Court last year and with your help, we
   can prove it again this year.
   My likely Republican opponent, Eric Hovde, is an anti-abortion extremist
   who wants to drag our country backwards by passing a national abortion
   ban. We simply can’t let that happen.

=========================================I wanted to pull back from politics for a moment to give you a little insight into why I do what I do.
I’m not that different from most parents.
I spend a lot of time thinking about the world our kids are living in now, and what kind of world we’re providing for them in the future.
My greatest mission is to create a world for my kids that’s better than the one I grew up in.
If you’re a parent, I’m sure you feel the same way.
And frankly, I refuse to sit by and do nothing knowing that Senator Kevin Cramer tried to cut the affordable healthcare that so many families rely on.
I refuse to sit by and do nothing while hardworking parents are struggling to find affordable housing or childcare for their kids.
I refuse to sit by and do nothing while the women of North Dakota worry that one of their most fundamental rights – how and when to have a family – will be stripped from them entirely.
That’s exactly why I’m running for U.S. Senate – to make sure all of our kids grow up in a country we can be proud of.
Right now, I have one of the best chances in the entire country to flip a Senate seat from red to blue. I’m running to create a better country for my family, and yours.

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

I wanted to pull back from politics for a moment to give you a little insight into why I do what I do.
I’m not that different from most parents.
I spend a lot of time thinking about the world our kids are living in now, and what kind of world we’re providing for them in the future.
My greatest mission is to create a world for my kids that’s better than the one I grew up in.
 My family and me
If you’re a parent, I’m sure you feel the same way.
And frankly, I refuse to sit by and do nothing knowing that Senator Kevin Cramer tried to cut the affordable healthcare that so many families rely on.
I refuse to sit by and do nothing while hardworking parents are struggling to find affordable housing or childcare for their kids.
I refuse to sit by and do nothing while the women of North Dakota worry that one of their most fundamental rights – how and when to have a family – will be stripped from them entirely.
That’s exactly why I’m running for U.S. Senate – to make sure all of our kids grow up in a country we can be proud of. 
Right now, I have one of the best chances in the entire country to flip a Senate seat from red to blue. I’m running to create a better country for my family, and yours. But I need your help to get there. I set an ambitious goal to raise 789 gifts before my End of Week Deadline in 12 hours. It would mean so much if I could count on your $15. >>

=========================================   A year ago, Chris sent the email below to announce that he was running for re-election and explain why he was staying in this fight. We wanted to re-share this with you today.
Since he sent this, the response has been humbling. Tens of thousands of people (including you!)  have chipped in since then to build a true grassroots campaign. Over 95% of our donations come from folks giving $100 or less — and not a dime from PACs or corporations.
Thank you so much for being a donor. Your support means the world to Chris and is the reason we are in a strong position today.
There are still a lot of tough fights ahead of us, but if we stay in this together, then we will prevail. If you are able to help us sustain our momentum, please consider contributing to our campaign today to fuel our people-powered movement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted you to hear this directly from me: I am officially running for re-election.
I love this work — being your voice and representing Connecticut in the U.S. Senate means the world to me.
So much has happened in these two years. Most importantly for me, we defied the odds and passed the first major gun safety bill in 30 years. As the author and champion of the bill, I know that the gun lobby is coming after me. And after we passed climate legislation and drug pricing legislation, I know the oil companies and drug industry are coming too. So I am counting on a lot of grassroots support as we kick off this race.
Will you please make a contribution to my re-election today to make sure we’re ready for whatever comes our way? Grassroots donations are the heart of our campaign. It is what allows me to focus on — and deliver — meaningful progressive change in the U.S. Senate.
CONTRIBUTE:https://act.chrismurphy.com/go/532?t=1001&akid=1822%2E2494310%2EzyeP4c
When I came to the Senate, there was a feeling of defeat amongst progressives. For decades, we had tried unsuccessfully to pass transformative legislation to lower carbon emissions. We had struck out, again and again, trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs. And we had been stymied, for three long decades, by the gun lobby. 
I ran for the Senate to be part of the group that would upend this status quo. And we did. We passed the biggest gun safety bill in nearly three decades, lowered prescription drug costs, made major investments in America’s infrastructure, and delivered the most aggressive climate action bill ever. Slowly but surely, we are shifting the power back from billionaires and corporations to the American people.
But the status quo fights back. And I know that the billionaires and the gun companies are going to throw the kitchen sink at me this campaign. 
So I cannot do this alone. The truth is Senate campaigns require significant resources, so I am asking for your support to help me start this re-election campaign strong:
Please contribute any amount you can afford to my re-election today. It’s important that we send a powerful message about the strength of our movement, and the donation itself is just as important as the amount.
CONTRIBUTE:https://act.chrismurphy.com/go/532?t=1002&akid=1822%2E2494310%2EzyeP4c
When we win, I plan to build on the success of the past two years. We need to pass voting rights legislation, restore the right to an abortion, and build on our 2022 gun safety bill by passing universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.
Thank you in advance for having my back. It means the world to me that so many people like you step up to answer the call when we need it.
There’s a lot of work ahead of us, but together, I know that we will be ready for anything.
Every best wish,
Chris Murphy

Hello,
When you’re a person of color, you’re used to being the only person that looks like you in a room. Despite the incredible diversity of our country, that fact is especially true in politics. It’s something I’ve been reflecting a lot on this Black History Month.
In fact, there have only been three Black women who have served in the United States Senate in its 235-year history. My good friend Lisa Blunt Rochester is running to add her name to that short list, but she can’t make history alone. She needs supporters like you and me by her side.
I’m going to tell you more about Lisa in a minute, but first I have to humbly ask if you’ll chip in $5 or more to this historic race. With Senate control on the line, every dollar you can spare will go directly towards defending Democrats’ razor-thin majority. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.02.06_B1_Abrams_30op&amount=5]
I’m supporting Lisa’s campaign because she’s spent her entire career working tirelessly to expand opportunities for families like her own. First in state government, then in Congress, and now she’s taking that fight to the Senate.
As a champion for gun reform, affordable health care, and the right to vote, there’s no question Lisa’s leadership is desperately needed in the Senate. The problem is, MAGA Republicans will say and spend whatever it takes to tip the scales in their favor.
Dedicated Democrats like you helped me make significant inroads for our party, but we cannot rest for a single minute. Lisa needs your help to expand her grassroots campaign, make history, and defend our Democratic Senate majority.
If you’re with us, will you rush $5 or more to help Lisa make history? All eyes will be on her as the first woman and Black person elected to serve Delaware in the Senate. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q12024?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.02.06_B1_Abrams_30op&amount=5]

=========================================Jenga, I like to say I come from a long line of strong, fearless women who didn’t know the meaning of the word “impossible.”
My grandmother, Polly, was a force of nature. She organized women into a political force in Albany — well before most women had any political power. 
My mother was one of just three women in her law school class — and a black belt in karate. I remember her baking cookies with my friends and me, all the while emptying the dishwasher and talking on the phone to file the details of an adoption case she was working on.
When I first ran for Congress back in 2006, my mom was one of the only people who thought I could win. I was told that my purple, upstate New York district had more cows than Democrats.
But I believed then — as I do now — that the toughest fights are always worth taking on. We won that race, and it’s been the honor of my life to serve New York ever since.
I’ve always said: Government only works when people raise their voices and demand change. It’s a pretty simple premise, really. But with Washington so overrun by corporate lobbyists and special interests who trade money for access, it doesn’t happen enough. 
But together, I believe that we can effect real, meaningful change in Washington. I believe we can protect and restore reproductive rights nationwide. I believe we can ensure that every American has quality, affordable health care. I believe we can fight global climate change, make paid family and medical leave a reality for all Americans, enact meaningful gun safety laws and build a more just and equitable economy.
With so much at stake, Jenga, I need your help. Democrats are hanging on to our Senate majority by a thread. Mitch McConnell only needs to flip two seats to retake control. And because I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, I can’t fight back against the GOP’s megadonor machine, keep this seat blue and defend our narrow majority without your grassroots support.
So please, will you donate $5 or more right now to help me defeat the GOP in New York, defend the Senate for Democrats and continue fearlessly fighting for you in Washington?

Jenga, I like to say I come from a long line of strong, fearless women who didn’t know the meaning of the word “impossible.”
My grandmother, Polly, was a force of nature. She organized women into a political force in Albany — well before most women had any political power. 
My mother was one of just three women in her law school class — and a black belt in karate. I remember her baking cookies with my friends and me, all the while emptying the dishwasher and talking on the phone to file the details of an adoption case she was working on.
When I first ran for Congress back in 2006, my mom was one of the only people who thought I could win. I was told that my purple, upstate New York district had more cows than Democrats.
But I believed then — as I do now — that the toughest fights are always worth taking on. We won that race, and it’s been the honor of my life to serve New York ever since.
I’ve always said: Government only works when people raise their voices and demand change. It’s a pretty simple premise, really. But with Washington so overrun by corporate lobbyists and special interests who trade money for access, it doesn’t happen enough. 
But together, I believe that we can effect real, meaningful change in Washington. I believe we can protect and restore reproductive rights nationwide. I believe we can ensure that every American has quality, affordable health care. I believe we can fight global climate change, make paid family and medical leave a reality for all Americans, enact meaningful gun safety laws and build a more just and equitable economy.
With so much at stake, Jenga, I need your help. Democrats are hanging on to our Senate majority by a thread. Mitch McConnell only needs to flip two seats to retake control. And because I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, I can’t fight back against the GOP’s megadonor machine, keep this seat blue and defend our narrow majority without your grassroots support.

=========================================                         [1]Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate
   We got some HUGE news yesterday,
   Jenga.
   Every candidate running for federal office was required to submit the full
   report of their campaign’s fourth-quarter fundraising numbers to the
   Federal Election Commission. And once Josh Hawley filed his report, we
   learned that Lucas didn’t just outraise him last quarter — our grassroots
   campaign outraised Hawley for all of 2023!
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43284?refcode=em20240201-4729&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4729%2E1040133%2EnYEO0J Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1001 ]BREAKING NEWS: Kunce outraises Hawley for Q4 and all of 2023, breaking
   records.
                            [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43284?refcode=em20240201-4729&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4729%2E1040133%2EnYEO0J Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1002 ]KEEP UP OUR MOMENTUM
   Last year, Lucas raised $5.4 million to defeat Josh Hawley — with an
   average donation of $33 and grassroots donors from every single county
   across the state, setting the record for the most ever raised in an
   off-year by a Senate challenger in Missouri.
   This is a historic accomplishment for a grassroots campaign in our state,
   and it wouldn’t have been possible without support from real people like
   you.
   But unfortunately, it’s not all good news today,
   Jenga:
   Yesterday’s reports also revealed that national insiders are still
   determined to bail out Josh Hawley. They transferred nearly $500,000
   directly into his campaign and raised more into the Super PAC they funded
   with $1M+ last summer.
                              [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43284?refcode=em20240201-4729&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4729%2E1040133%2EnYEO0J Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1003 ]FIGHT BACK NOW →
   At this point, it’s not surprising. The insiders and elites backing Hawley
   have known Lucas was a threat since the day he got into this race. They’ve
   acted on it too, with desperate attacks and big investments into Hawley’s
   campaign quarter after quarter.
   But things got worse for Hawley at the end of last year. Morning Consult
   confirmed that he’s the least popular Republican Senator up for
   re-election in 2024. Then, multiple polls showed Lucas already in a
   margin-of-error race with Hawley — making this our best opportunity to
   flip a GOP-held U.S. Senate seat in this election cycle.
   With all that new information and likely lots more to come, we know those
   insiders are bound to ramp up their spending and attacks against Lucas
   from here.
   They’ll do anything it takes to make Hawley look strong in this race and
   they’re hoping their early investments will give him the edge he needs to
   win.
   That’s why we’re urgently asking for your help today,
   Jenga. Our grassroots campaign to elect Lucas
   Kunce is entirely powered by real people like you — not shady mega-donors
   or corporate elites. So when you donate to our campaign, you’re giving us
   the ability to fight back against the GOP’s desperate attacks, reach
   voters in every corner of the state with Lucas’ unifying message, and win
   this race in November.

   you can afford to our grassroots movement to elect Lucas Kunce right now?
   With multiple recent polls showing this race in a dead heat, your support
   today could help us close the gap, defeat Josh Hawley, and flip Missouri’s
   U.S. Senate seat this year.

   Katie Porter is always willing to call out BS, whether it comes from
   Republicans or Democrats. So when Adam Schiff released an ad that promotes
   our Republican opponent and claims that two men are the only leading
   candidates, Katie set the record straight. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240204-2?refcode=em20240204-37225&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37225_10298894_lsOFSy&akid=37225%2E10298894%2ElsOFSy ]Watch for yourself:

   Schiff’s ad is a deliberate attempt to consolidate conservative support
   behind the leading Republican candidate, Steve Garvey. Because of
   California’s unique primary, the top two vote-getters, regardless of
   party, advance to the November general election. Adam knows he’ll easily
   beat Republican Steve Garvey if he’s in the general election. But Adam
   also knows that polling shows Katie has a strong chance of becoming
   California’s next U.S. Senator so long as we make it out of the primary.
   Right now, Katie and our Republican opponent are in a dead heat in the
   race to qualify for the general election.
   Ads like the one Schiff released, which attempt to game the system, are
   why Americans distrust politicians. And with just 25 women in the U.S.
   Senate, it’s disappointing to see qualified women candidates dismissed
   like this. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240204-2?refcode=em20240204-37225&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37225_10298894_lsOFSy&akid=37225%2E10298894%2ElsOFSy ]We can’t let this be the reason we lose Katie’s voice in

Katie Porter is always willing to call out BS, whether it comes from Republicans or Democrats. So when Adam Schiff released an ad that promotes our Republican opponent and claims that two men are the only leading candidates, Katie set the record straight. Watch for yourself:
Schiff’s ad is a deliberate attempt to consolidate conservative support behind the leading Republican candidate, Steve Garvey. Because of California’s unique primary, the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to the November general election. Adam knows he’ll easily beat Republican Steve Garvey if he’s in the general election. But Adam also knows that polling shows Katie has a strong chance of becoming California’s next U.S. Senator so long as we make it out of the primary.
Right now, Katie and our Republican opponent are in a dead heat in the race to qualify for the general election.
Ads like the one Schiff released, which attempt to game the system, are why Americans distrust politicians. And with just 25 women in the U.S. Senate, it’s disappointing to see qualified women candidates dismissed like this. We can’t let this be the reason we lose Katie’s voice in Congress for good. Is there anything you can donate today to help power our campaign?

   Adam Schiff is running ads to boost a Republican and keep us out of this

   The Schiff ad may look harmless at first watch, but it’s a deliberate
   strategy to consolidate conservative support behind Steve Garvey. Because
   of California’s open top-two primary system, if enough Republicans vote
   for Garvey, Katie will come in third, and be out of this race—and out of
   Congress—for good.
   As one strategist was quoted in Politico saying, “These ads from Schiff
   will do more to promote Garvey than anything Garvey can do on his own.”
   A poll released today shows Steve Garvey and Katie tied for second place,
   so these ads really could be the difference in this race. Californians
   deserve better.
   With roughly a quarter of voters still undecided, this race is far from
   over. Can you help us run our own ads highlighting Katie’s record and
   priorities by contributing $5 today?

   Jenga, it’s Senator Chris Van Hollen.
   You might already know that I am enthusiastically supporting Angela
   Alsobrooks because she will be a strong progressive partner in fighting
   for the issues that all Marylanders care about in the U.S. Senate.
   But did you know that Angela is facing a critical End-of-Month deadline on
   Wednesday? 
   And that if she doesn’t reach her $50,000 goal by Wednesday at midnight,
   she’ll run the risk of getting drowned out by her self-funded,
   multi-millionaire opponent in this ultra-competitive race?
   Trust me, I know firsthand how important small-dollar, grassroots
   donations are to running a people-powered campaign in a race as
   competitive as this one. [ https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/9768?t=1010&amount=25&akid=977%2E630668%2E62Q4aS ]So please, will you rush a $25 donation right

   Jenga, Angela knows how to deliver real results for Maryland’s
   working families.
   She has spent her career in public service fighting for the issues that
   matter most—and I would be honored for Angela to join me in the Senate so
   that, together, we can stand up to deep-pocketed, powerful, special
   interests and even the playing field for all Marylanders. Angela never
   backs down in the fight for what’s right. She’s the partner I need to meet
   the urgency of this moment in defending our democracy and protecting
   abortion access.
   But before we get there, Angela needs your continued support before
   Wednesday’s all-important End-of-Month fundraising deadline.

Friend – I thought my days of putting people on the ground were over when I
left the NFL. *Then January 6th happened.*
I was on the House floor when rioters breached the Capitol, and I remember
hearing the glass break and the shouts coming closer.
*As they pounded on the doors, I texted my wife Aly, who was seven months
pregnant with our second son: "Whatever happens, I love you." *
I took off my jacket and got ready to fight anyone who came through the
door. Thankfully, it never came to that.
*And while I was barricaded on the House floor with my colleagues and our
gas masks in hand, Ted Cruz – who had cheered on the mob earlier that day –
hid in a supply closet.*
Ted Cruz’s false claims about the 2020 election helped incite the
insurrection. *That's Ted for you: All hat, no cattle.*
*That day is one of many, many reasons I know Ted Cruz has got to go.*
People lost their lives, and our government came the closest it ever has to
crumbling. His MAGA extremism is bad for Texas and our country, and it’s
time to hold him accountable.
*I’m running to replace Ted Cruz and give Texans the Senator we deserve,
and I hope you’ll help me do it, friend.* And a new poll from last week
showed me just 2 points behind Ted Cruz and *statistically tied* – up from
5 points down in a 2023 poll. It couldn't be clearer – we can win this race
in November *if* we have the resources to do it.
*But our very first end-of-month deadline of the year is approaching fast,
and right now, we're falling short of this critical goal. **Will you donate
now to help build our grassroots movement and defeat Ted Cruz once and for
all? Any amount you can spare is truly appreciated. →*

Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real
leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots
movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to
“Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are
predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas,
defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

Friend – I thought my days of putting people on the ground were over when I left the NFL. Then January 6th happened.
I was on the House floor when rioters breached the Capitol, and I remember hearing the glass break and the shouts coming closer.
As they pounded on the doors, I texted my wife Aly, who was seven months pregnant with our second son: "Whatever happens, I love you." 
I took off my jacket and got ready to fight anyone who came through the door. Thankfully, it never came to that.
And while I was barricaded on the House floor with my colleagues and our gas masks in hand, Ted Cruz – who had cheered on the mob earlier that day – hid in a supply closet.
Ted Cruz’s false claims about the 2020 election helped incite the insurrection. That's Ted for you: All hat, no cattle.
That day is one of many, many reasons I know Ted Cruz has got to go. People lost their lives, and our government came the closest it ever has to crumbling. His MAGA extremism is bad for Texas and our country, and it’s time to hold him accountable.
I’m running to replace Ted Cruz and give Texans the Senator we deserve, and I hope you’ll help me do it, friend. And a new poll from last week showed me just 2 points behind Ted Cruz and statistically tied – up from 5 points down in a 2023 poll. It couldn't be clearer – we can win this race in November if we have the resources to do it.
But our very first end-of-month deadline of the year is approaching fast, and right now, we're falling short of this critical goal. Will you donate now to help build our grassroots movement and defeat Ted Cruz once and for all? Any amount you can spare is truly appreciated. →
DONATE →
Thank you so much,
									Colin Allred
						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

Greetings #TeamAlsobrooks,
Last week on the campaign trail was absolutely spectacular! Thank you to
all the folks who came out across the state to support the campaign.
Momentum is building across Maryland for Angela’s campaign, and we are so
grateful to have your help.
Take a look below for some highlights from the campaign trail and beyond!
*THIS WEEK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL*
Angela spent time in Montgomery County where she was joined by friends and
supporters for a wonderful discussion about how she will help deliver for
communities of all types across Maryland.
<https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/2570?t=7&akid=983%2E630668%2EJmk402>
<https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/2570?t=8&akid=983%2E630668%2EJmk402>
Angela spent Sunday morning in fellowship at DreamLife Worship Center with
Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski. Thank you to Dr. Kenneth
Robinson and Pastor Lenyar Robinson for such a powerful service.
<https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/2570?t=9&akid=983%2E630668%2EJmk402>
Angela was in Gaithersburg, where she got to chat with some remarkable
folks about how we can continue to bolster our great state. Special thanks
to Elly Shaw Belbidia and Joe and Sue Palka for bringing together your
neighbors and friends for a terrific conversation!
<https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/2570?t=10&akid=983%2E630668%2EJmk402>
<https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/2570?t=11&akid=983%2E630668%2EJmk402>
At Towson University, Angela was honored to be joined by Congressman John
Sarbanes who endorsed her candidacy and helped lead a discussion with
student leaders about the importance of defending democracy. Congressman
Sarbanes is behind Angela because he knows that the power of the many
outweighs the power of money, and we’re so excited to have him on the team.
<https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/2570?t=12&akid=983%2E630668%2EJmk402>
The Ravens game isn’t the only big event happening in Baltimore this
weekend! On Friday, we are opening our new campaign office in Baltimore to

=========================================Stew, Campaign Manager
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_february_2024?refcode=jtk3405-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Hey friend – it's Stew (Jacky Rosen's campaign manager). 
In 90 minutes, I have a budget meeting with Jacky – and just between us, I'm not looking forward to it. Based on our latest fundraising numbers, I have to tell Jacky that we need to make some tough calls on what to cut from our budget plan. 
I'm not sounding the alarm just yet. I did the math – and if we can raise $5,169 in the next 90 minutes, we won't have to make any budget cuts. It's ambitious, but if this grassroots team bands together, I know we can make it happen. 
So please, will you chip in $5, $25, or $50 to get us back on track so we can win in Nevada and defend the Senate for Democrats?

Hey friend – it's Stew (Jacky Rosen's campaign manager). 
In 90 minutes, I have a budget meeting with Jacky – and just between us, I'm not looking forward to it. Based on our latest fundraising numbers, I have to tell Jacky that we need to make some tough calls on what to cut from our budget plan. 
I'm not sounding the alarm just yet. I did the math – and if we can raise $5,169 in the next 90 minutes, we won't have to make any budget cuts. It's ambitious, but if this grassroots team bands together, I know we can make it happen. 
So please, will you chip in $5, $25, or $50 to get us back on track so we can win in Nevada and defend the Senate for Democrats?
Thanks so much, 
									Stew 
A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

   A goal without a deadline is just a dream.
   It’s one of my favorite sayings, and it’s especially true when you’re
   running a campaign.
   And here’s the thing, our fundraising deadlines this close to Election Day
   are especially critical—money coming in the door on March 1st isn’t going
   to go as far as dollars that come in right now. The earlier we secure
   financial resources, the earlier we’re able to reserve ad time, which
   means we get better rates and better ad placements.
   This is the make or break point of our election cycle. Ballots are being
   mailed in just one week, and with 20% of voters undecided, we have to get
   our message out there. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240127-2?refcode=em20240127-37046&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37046_10298894_WvS3Ue&akid=37046%2E10298894%2EWvS3Ue ]Can you help us meet our January goal by

   The goal is an ambitious $275,000, and the deadline is Wednesday, January

=========================================   Look at this guy. He knows that his path to the White House goes through Arizona. 
'Donald Trump'
And this guy — he knows that if he’s going to become the Senate Majority Leader, he needs Arizona. 
'Mitch McConnell'
And Kari Lake — after losing by less than 17,000 votes in 2022, she’s going to do whatever she has to do to win. 
'Kari Lake'
But this guy is standing in their way. 
'Ruben Gallego'
He can’t do it alone. He’s going to need a huge team behind him if we’re going to stop Trump, McConnell, and Kari Lake.

=========================================   Friend: 
We’ve sent a lot of fundraising emails over the last few days as we approach tonight’s fundraising deadline. We’re sorry about that. Really. 
If we could win this race without sending a single email, we’d do it. But the truth is, these emails are the primary way we fund this campaign — alongside the texts you might get, and the ads you see. 
So we hope you see them more as an indication of how important you are to this campaign, rather than an annoying thing you have to slog through. 
And we hope that when you see Ruben’s commercials on TV, when you see Ruben overtaking Kari Lake in the polls, when you see Ruben win in Arizona and help defend our Senate majority — know that you played a huge part. 
We wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell without you. 
But with our deadline just a few hours away now, we’ve got to ask: 
Can Ruben count on you to make a donation to his campaign before that midnight deadline? This first fundraising push of the year is going to determine how strong a campaign we can run. It’s up to you. 
Contribute: https://act.gallegoforarizona.com/go/2374?t=1001&akid=1909%2E6821758%2EPGnmCt
With your donation, we’re proving a point: You can defeat somebody like Kari Lake without selling out. You can do it with the support of a huge team — full of people like you. 
So thank you.

=========================================Hi, Jenga, I wanted you to see these messages from my team: Right now, we're on track to fall short of our critical end-of-month fundraising goal, with just hours to go until the deadline.
We need to close the gap immediately. With experts saying our race will decide Senate control, recent polls show me running a competitive race with my self-funding GOP opponents. But while they're spending their personal fortunes to try to buy this seat, I'm running a true grassroots campaign that relies on folks like you.
That's why I'm turning to top supporters like you, Jenga: Will you make your first gift now? Even $5 or $25 will make a huge difference in our fight to win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue.

Please see Olivia's email below – unfortunately, we're still well short of our January goal. I know it's a busy day, but could you find time to reach out to a few of our top supporters and let them know how important this is? We really need to make up the gap by midnight.

Going into the last day of the month, we're still $39,283 short of our goal. We need to pull out all the stops to make up this gap, so can you ask Sherrod to reach out to some top supporters ASAP? If we can get 1,000 or so people to chip in before midnight, it should put us in a good place.

   Jenga, my Finance Director, Taylor, reached out to give me an
   update. Take a look:
   Senator, since our opponent outraised us, we’ve been working hard to see
   how we can close the gap heading into 2024. I’ve crunched the numbers
   with the team and if we can hit our goal for February, it’ll make a big
   difference. Could you reach out to some of our top supporters with a
   personal ask to help? Every dollar counts right now. Thank you!
   Taylor
                  Thanks for the update, Taylor. I’ll send a note today. Bob
   Jenga, with the Senate majority hinging on Pennsylvania, we’re
   going to need resources to fight back — but my opponent, Mitch McConnell,
   and GOP super PACs are doing everything in their power to defeat me, and a
   recent poll shows this race tightening. That’s why I’m asking for your
   support today.

I’ve crunched the numbers with the team and if we can hit our goal for February, it’ll make a big difference. Could you reach out to some of our top supporters with a personal ask to help? Every dollar counts right now. Thank you!
Taylor
Thanks for the update, Taylor. I’ll send a note today.
Bob
Jenga, with the Senate majority hinging on Pennsylvania, we’re going to need resources to fight back — but my opponent, Mitch McConnell, and GOP super PACs are doing everything in their power to defeat me, and a recent poll shows this race tightening. That’s why I’m asking for your support today.
Will you chip in $5 right now to help me continue fighting for Pennsylvania? As Taylor said, any amount goes a long way in a race this competitive.

   King Day weekend, January 2021.
   I grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Jeff City. Like so many
   Americans, my parents lived paycheck-to-paycheck — so when my little
   sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us.
   Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, we struggled to get by.
   But we weren’t alone.
   When my parents had to take my sister to get surgeries at a hospital over
   100 miles away in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings
   and me into their homes.
   And when we couldn’t afford groceries, they brought more casserole and
   lasagna by the house than we could ever hope to eat.
   That’s the Missouri I grew up in.

   home.
   The support from our neighbors and friends motivated me to work hard, stay
   focused on school, and run on the cross-country team. After graduating
   from Jefferson City High School, I was able to get into Yale — which I
   could afford in part due to a Pell grant and scholarships from people
   around town.
   I got to keep running at Yale, too.

   After undergrad and then law school at Mizzou, I joined the Marine Corps
   to honor and serve the community that had done so much for me.
   Less than a year after I completed training, I deployed to Iraq on my
   first of three tours of duty in the War on Terror, before later being
   stationed at the Pentagon.
   During those 13 years of active duty I learned firsthand what service and
   sacrifice for your country really means: Doing the right thing when you’re
   thousands of miles from home, believing in a mission that’s bigger than
   yourself, and never forgetting the community you signed up to serve.

   In Iraq, I deployed to the Sunni Triangle where I led a police training
   team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman, running missions through
   Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. From our camp, the base’s burn pit
   loomed over us.
   Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran
   through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three
   months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on
   our duty.
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/26802?refcode=em20240128-4698&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4698%2E1040133%2ELGMLVh Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1008 ]Photos of the burn pit Lucas lived next to in Iraq.
   When I got back from living next to that burn pit, I had developed a
   persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies
   before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I
   was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic.
   They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy
   medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, it’s
   still there.
   Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And that’s about the
   best story you’ll hear about a vet who’s been exposed to burn pits. Many
   struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer.
   So imagine how we all felt when politicians who had never worn the
   uniform, like Josh Hawley, threw us a giant middle finger and voted
   against aid for exposed veterans.

   My final tour was on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. There, I worked with
   the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Homeland
   Security, FBI, CIA, and other agencies to stop the proliferation of
   nuclear, chemical, and missile technology around the globe, to keep these
   weapons out of the hands of bad actors.
   I spent every day doing what I could to make the world a safer place, with
   fewer arms, less chance of conflict, and more money to spend on improving
   lives rather than destroying them.
   One of the hardest things for me between these tours was coming back home
   to Jeff City, to the community I had signed up to serve, and seeing what
   was going on in my old neighborhood.
   When I came back from Iraq, the first house I’d ever lived in was
   bulldozed down. Now, it’s an empty lot:
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/26802?refcode=em20240128-4698&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4698%2E1040133%2ELGMLVh Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1010 ]The empty lot where Lucas' childhood home once stood.
   When I came back from Afghanistan, the house I lived in when I joined the
   Marine Corps was vacant and starting to fall apart. The corner store was
   boarded up.
   The whole time all of us were risking our lives overseas, our leaders were
   spending trillions of dollars trying to build up towns in these other
   countries — places like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat — when we should
   have been spending our money, blood, and sweat on towns like St. Joe, St.
   Louis, and Jefferson City.
   From the Middle East to the Pentagon, my time in the Marine Corps provided
   me with direct insight into the control that giant corporations have over
   our tax dollars, our politics, and our everyday lives.
   So after active duty, I joined the American Economic Liberties Project —
   the nation’s leading non-profit in the fight against monopoly power in our
   economy and our democracy. We took on the corrupt politicians and
   monopolists who dominate our lives, squeeze small businesses out of our
   markets, and enrich corporate elites at the expense of everyday Americans
   — from Big Tech and agribusiness conglomerates, to pharmaceutical cartels
   and defense contractors.
   But now corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley don’t just attack our way of
   life, but the democracy I swore to defend.
   Everyday people should be calling the shots in our country — not giant
   corporations or the cowards and phonies they bought off in Washington.
   That’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate: To take power back for working
   families in Missouri and across America.
   And make no mistake about it, Missouri is on the frontline of this fight.
   While our state has been getting stripped for parts, politicians like Josh
   Hawley have been attacking workers with schemes like “Right-to-Work” and
   fighting to block wage increases for Missouri families — all to enrich
   multinational corporations and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns.
   As dozens of headquarters have been taken out of state, politicians in
   power like Josh Hawley were happy to sit back and watch it happen.
   Manufacturing, agriculture, production — they’re shipping it all away to
   foreign oligarchs who don’t care about working people in our state. And
   while Missouri was getting gutted, these same politicians voted time and
   time again to spend trillions of dollars and thousands of lives on
   overseas wars that got their Big Oil friends rich.
   They’ve spent decades sparking phony culture wars to distract and divide
   our families. They’ve become so obsessed with controlling our lives, they
   made Missouri the first state in the nation to ban abortion — without
   exceptions for victims of rape or incest.
   Our state deserves a Senator who will stand up and fight for it, not run
   for the exit like Josh Hawley.
   I’m running for U.S. Senate to be the warrior for working people that
   Missouri deserves — to fight like hell for our state and our people.
   We’ve spent months uniting Missouri’s election-winning labor movement
   behind our campaign — with early endorsements from the Missouri AFL-CIO,
   Missouri Fire Fighters, and dozens more statewide and union locals. And
   multiple recent polls have shown we’re already in a tight race against
   Hawley, who Morning Consult has consistently found to be the most
   vulnerable GOP Senator running in 2024.
   But if we’re going to stand up to the DC insiders and corporate elites
   spending millions to prop up Hawley and keep their grip on this Senate
   seat, we need your support to continue building a record-breaking,
   people-powered movement.
   I’m not taking a single cent from corporate PACs in this race so we can
   stand up to the status quo and take back power for real working people
   across the state. [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/26802?refcode=em20240128-4698&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4698%2E1040133%2ELGMLVh Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1011 ]So

   We can stop printing money for Wall Street and start funding our schools
   enough to get Missouri out of last place for starting teacher pay.
   And we can abolish corporate PACs and demand a government that safeguards
   our democracy and holds corrupt politicians accountable.
   We can build an economy that puts American workers and small businesses
   first, not giant corporations and foreign oligarchs — an economy that
   invests in the next generation of energy.
   We can put an end to pointless, trillion-dollar wars and invest in a
   Marshall Plan for the Midwest — a historic investment in our workers and
   communities to rebuild our forgotten towns and cities, and to finally
   start making stuff in America again.

Further along in this email, I’m going to ask you to join our grassroots movement to flip Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat. But first, will you please give me just a few moments of your time to introduce myself?

In Iraq, I deployed to the Sunni Triangle where I led a police training team. Twelve Marines and a Navy Corpsman, running missions through Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Ramadi. From our camp, the base’s burn pit loomed over us.
Smoke columns filled the sky and blew through our living space. We ran through it, joking about how we should be doing gas mask runs. For three months that pit bathed us in toxic fumes. We accepted it and focused on our duty.
When I got back from living next to that burn pit, I had developed a persistent tickle in my throat. Constant irritation. I never had allergies before and annoyed myself with the constant throat clearing. Eventually, I was so embarrassed by it that I went to the base clinic.
They said it was postnasal drip and that they could give me allergy medicine. There was no formal diagnosis. But over 10 years later, it’s still there.
Bothersome. Uncomfortable, but certainly manageable. And that’s about the best story you’ll hear about a vet who’s been exposed to burn pits. Many struggle with chronic respiratory issues. Migraines. Cancer.
So imagine how we all felt when politicians who had never worn the uniform, like Josh Hawley, threw us a giant middle finger and voted against aid for exposed veterans.
My final tour was on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. There, I worked with the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, and other agencies to stop the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technology around the globe, to keep these weapons out of the hands of bad actors.
I spent every day doing what I could to make the world a safer place, with fewer arms, less chance of conflict, and more money to spend on improving lives rather than destroying them.
One of the hardest things for me between these tours was coming back home to Jeff City, to the community I had signed up to serve, and seeing what was going on in my old neighborhood.
When I came back from Iraq, the first house I’d ever lived in was bulldozed down. Now, it’s an empty lot:
When I came back from Afghanistan, the house I lived in when I joined the Marine Corps was vacant and starting to fall apart. The corner store was boarded up.
The whole time all of us were risking our lives overseas, our leaders were spending trillions of dollars trying to build up towns in these other countries — places like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat — when we should have been spending our money, blood, and sweat on towns like St. Joe, St. Louis, and Jefferson City.
From the Middle East to the Pentagon, my time in the Marine Corps provided me with direct insight into the control that giant corporations have over our tax dollars, our politics, and our everyday lives.
So after active duty, I joined the American Economic Liberties Project — the nation’s leading non-profit in the fight against monopoly power in our economy and our democracy. We took on the corrupt politicians and monopolists who dominate our lives, squeeze small businesses out of our markets, and enrich corporate elites at the expense of everyday Americans — from Big Tech and agribusiness conglomerates, to pharmaceutical cartels and defense contractors.
But now corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley don’t just attack our way of life, but the democracy I swore to defend.
Everyday people should be calling the shots in our country — not giant corporations or the cowards and phonies they bought off in Washington. That’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate: To take power back for working families in Missouri and across America.
And make no mistake about it, Missouri is on the frontline of this fight.
While our state has been getting stripped for parts, politicians like Josh Hawley have been attacking workers with schemes like “Right-to-Work” and fighting to block wage increases for Missouri families — all to enrich multinational corporations and mega-donors who bankroll their campaigns.
As dozens of headquarters have been taken out of state, politicians in power like Josh Hawley were happy to sit back and watch it happen.
Manufacturing, agriculture, production — they’re shipping it all away to foreign oligarchs who don’t care about working people in our state. And while Missouri was getting gutted, these same politicians voted time and time again to spend trillions of dollars and thousands of lives on overseas wars that got their Big Oil friends rich.
They’ve spent decades sparking phony culture wars to distract and divide our families. They’ve become so obsessed with controlling our lives, they made Missouri the first state in the nation to ban abortion — without exceptions for victims of rape or incest.
Our state deserves a Senator who will stand up and fight for it, not run for the exit like Josh Hawley.
I’m running for U.S. Senate to be the warrior for working people that Missouri deserves — to fight like hell for our state and our people.
We’ve spent months uniting Missouri’s election-winning labor movement behind our campaign — with early endorsements from the Missouri AFL-CIO, Missouri Fire Fighters, and dozens more statewide and union locals. And multiple recent polls have shown we’re already in a tight race against Hawley, who Morning Consult has consistently found to be the most vulnerable GOP Senator running in 2024.
But if we’re going to stand up to the DC insiders and corporate elites spending millions to prop up Hawley and keep their grip on this Senate seat, we need your support to continue building a record-breaking, people-powered movement.
I’m not taking a single cent from corporate PACs in this race so we can stand up to the status quo and take back power for real working people across the state. So Jenga, will you join our people-powered movement by chipping in $10 or whatever you can afford today?

We can stop printing money for Wall Street and start funding our schools enough to get Missouri out of last place for starting teacher pay.
And we can abolish corporate PACs and demand a government that safeguards our democracy and holds corrupt politicians accountable.
We can build an economy that puts American workers and small businesses first, not giant corporations and foreign oligarchs — an economy that invests in the next generation of energy.
We can put an end to pointless, trillion-dollar wars and invest in a Marshall Plan for the Midwest — a historic investment in our workers and communities to rebuild our forgotten towns and cities, and to finally start making stuff in America again.
It’s time to take our power back.
Thanks for hearing me out,
— Lucas Kunce

=========================================Friend: Early voting begins in California TODAY – and while polls show that this is still anyone's race, I urgently need one final fundraising push to get out the vote on the ground: Please, will you rush a donation to my Senate campaign now?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1024-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
I just wanted to take a moment to take stock of all that we've built here together. For much of this race, I've been outraised by my opponents by millions of dollars – but we haven't let that inhibit us. Thanks to this incredibly passionate grassroots team, we've been able to reach voters up and down the state with our vision for progress, and our momentum is catching.
My campaign for Senate received the most endorsements at the California Democratic Party Convention – and, with as many as 20% of voters still undecided, I truly do mean it when I say that this race is still up for grabs.
So here's how we're going to do this: With people casting their votes in the primary election right now, we're going to drastically expand our grassroots efforts to get out the vote – and I'm counting on you to help fund these efforts. 
There is no time to waste – not when the election has officially begun. Please, will you rush a donation to my campaign now and help send me to the U.S. Senate?

Let’s recap a few key events, folks —
FIRST : Martin’s new Republican challenger launched her campaign to unseat him, pouring $500,000 of her own funds into New Mexico’s U.S. Senate race.
THEN : Mitch McConnell’s allies came out in full support of the hedge fund executive, a mega-millionaire who is the daughter of the last Republican Senator to represent New Mexico.
NOW : We need to prepare for the inevitable: Martin’s new opponent can write herself another big check at any moment, on top of any support she gets from national Republicans. At the drop of a hat, our challenger or GOP super PACs could flood the airwaves with misleading ads about Martin's record.
SO : It’s more important than ever to hit our fundraising milestones, like tonight’s end-of-month fundraising goal, to respond to any attacks and get Martin’s message out.

Friend, I’m Colin Allred, and I’m running for U.S. Senate to defeat Ted
Cruz and deliver better, stronger leadership for the people of Texas.
CNN is already calling Ted Cruz one of the most vulnerable senators in the
country and experts from Roll Call to Inside Elections officially named
Texas a "Battleground" state.
*That’s why I'm so glad to have you on my team. Support from grassroots
donors like you is the only way I can win this race, so please, will you
chip in $5 – or whatever you can spare – to my campaign? *Every dollar you
can spare will help us build a people-powered movement to defeat Ted Cruz,
flip Texas blue and defend our Senate majority. Please donate now →

I’m a fourth-generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas by a single mom.
My mom was a public school teacher and sometimes worked two jobs to make
ends meet. Thanks to my family and a strong support system of teachers,
coaches and the good folks at the YMCA, I earned a full-ride football
scholarship to Baylor University and then went on to play in the NFL.
But playing football was never my only dream – from a young age I knew I
wanted to help people. So I became a civil rights attorney to defend what I
believe is our most fundamental right: the right to vote. I proudly served
in President Obama’s administration before I came home to Dallas, where I’m
now raising my family.
*I ran for Congress because I wanted more kids in North Texas to have the
opportunity to achieve their version of the American dream and protect the
fundamental values of our democracy – and I beat the odds to defeat an
11-term Republican incumbent, helping Democrats flip the House blue in
2018. *
*Now, I’m ready for my next challenge:* taking on Ted Cruz. I know it won’t
be easy, but I also know that Texans deserve so much better than Ted Cruz’s
cynical partisan politics. *Everything Ted Cruz does is for Ted Cruz – when
I’m in the Senate, everything I do will be to help people like you. But I
can’t get there alone:*
*That’s why I’m asking you to chip in right now to my campaign. We’re going
to need an unprecedented grassroots movement to unseat Ted Cruz, and I’m
counting on you to be a part of it – please, rush $5, or whatever you can
spare, to help me win in Texas and defeat Ted Cruz →*

Friend, I’m Colin Allred, and I’m running for U.S. Senate to defeat Ted Cruz and deliver better, stronger leadership for the people of Texas. 
CNN is already calling Ted Cruz one of the most vulnerable senators in the country and experts from Roll Call to Inside Elections officially named Texas a "Battleground" state.
That’s why I'm so glad to have you on my team. Support from grassroots donors like you is the only way I can win this race, so please, will you chip in $5 – or whatever you can spare – to my campaign? Every dollar you can spare will help us build a people-powered movement to defeat Ted Cruz, flip Texas blue and defend our Senate majority.

=========================================Friend, we have less than 12 hours before my critical end-of-month deadline, so I'm just going to tell it like it is:
— Ted Cruz won his last election by only 2.6%.
— Thanks to his GOP mega donors, he has $7.3 MILLION in the bank.
— Right now, we're falling $43,730 short of our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline, and we have less than 12 hours to close the gap.
Ted Cruz's millionaires and special interests are scared because they know we can win this thing. They're throwing everything they've got behind him. I'm counting on you to ensure I can compete with Cruz's millionaire donors:
So, with just hours left until my midnight deadline, can you chip in any amount you're able so that we have the resources to send Ted Cruz packing for good? →

Friend, we have less than 12 hours before my critical end-of-month deadline, so I'm just going to tell it like it is:
— Ted Cruz won his last election by only 2.6%.
— Thanks to his GOP mega donors, he has $7.3 MILLION in the bank.
— Right now, we're falling $43,730 short of our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline, and we have less than 12 hours to close the gap.
Ted Cruz's millionaires and special interests are scared because they know we can win this thing. They're throwing everything they've got behind him. I'm counting on you to ensure I can compete with Cruz's millionaire donors:
So, with just hours left until my midnight deadline, can you chip in any amount you're able so that we have the resources to send Ted Cruz packing for good? →
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Thank you for joining my fight to fire Ted Cruz,
									-Colin
						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================Remember the Initiatives?
** Remember the Initiatives?
------------------------------------------------------------
Our state’s Democratic lawmakers are failing to uphold constitutional mandates by obstructing the consideration of voter-backed initiatives. Despite the Washington Constitution's clear directives, none of the six certified initiatives before the state legislature have been granted the priority they deserve.
I-2113 - Reasonable Police Pursuit
1-2117 - Stop the Hidden Gas Tax
I-2124 - Opt Out of State-Run Long Term Care Coverage Act
I-2109 - Repeal the Capital Gains Tax
I-2111 - No State Income Tax
I-2081 - Parental Notification
These initiatives address critical issues such as allowing police to pursue dangerous criminals, lowering gas prices by repealing the carbon tax, parental notification laws, capital gains income tax abolition, lowering payroll taxes, and prohibition of state and local income taxes. Republican efforts to prioritize hearings for these initiatives have been unanimously rejected by House Democrats, while bills granting extensive influence to the Attorney General over fiscal notes for alternative initiatives have received swift attention.
This disregard for constitutional duty by our legislators undermines the voice of Washingtonians and the integrity of the democratic process.  There are over 2.6 million signatures for these initiatives, expecting our lawmakers to take the swift and decisive action they are legally required to take.
I’m asking that you write and/or call your Representatives and Senators and demand that they act on the Initiatives!

=========================================Jenga,
Last week, my colleagues and I on the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing about the harmful effects of social media on children and teens.
For too long, tech companies have said, "Just trust us, we've got this." But we know these platforms have repeatedly put profits over people, with algorithms pushing dangerous content to our children.
These companies need to step up and protect our kids online. That’s why we need to pass my bills to hold Big Tech accountable.
I’ll never stop working to deliver results on important issues facing our country. If you’re with me, I hope you’ll make a quick donation to my reelection campaign so I can continue my efforts in the Senate.

Jenga,
Last week, my colleagues and I on the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing about the harmful effects of social media on children and teens.
For too long, tech companies have said, "Just trust us, we've got this." But we know these platforms have repeatedly put profits over people, with algorithms pushing dangerous content to our children.
These companies need to step up and protect our kids online. That’s why we need to pass my bills to hold Big Tech accountable.
I’ll never stop working to deliver results on important issues facing our country. If you’re with me, I hope you’ll make a quick donation to my reelection campaign so I can continue my efforts in the Senate.

=========================================I'll be straight with you, Jenga. I'm reaching out this morning to ask for $5.
I'm about to explain why, but if you're ready to chip in $5 to help me hit our critical $250,000 end-of-month goal before our deadline, you can click here to donate now.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1252-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5&recurring=1
Look, Jenga: As soon as CNN reported that I was one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, Mitch McConnell made my seat his top target to flip red and take back the Senate majority.
So now I'm facing GOP millionaire opponents in a toss-up race – and if I can't make up the gap on my end-of-month fundraising goal, they'll know the multimillion-dollar attack ads are worth it.
I know $5 might not seem like much in comparison to the GOP's millions – but if you join the thousands of grassroots folks who've already given $5 this week, we'll be on track to meet this critical goal and have the resources it takes to fight back and win.
Unlike my GOP opponents, I can't just write my campaign another check. I'm counting on grassroots folks like you to power us to victory. So please, Jenga, will you chip in $5 – or anything you can spare – so we can win in Ohio and keep this Senate seat blue?

None of this is possible without you. Thank you.

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.
									Thank you!

=========================================   Look, if everybody reading this email right now chipped in just $5 before midnight, we could call off our entire end-of-month fundraising drive. We’d absolutely crush our goals. 
But not everyone gives, and honestly, we haven’t gotten anywhere near the amount of donations we need so far this month. 
That’s why we need you today — because we’re in real danger of falling short of our goal. 
We don’t have to crush every goal. But we can’t miss our first goal of the year. That is not an option. 
Not with Trump, Lake, and the entire MAGA-right lining up against us. Not with special interests and dark money groups preparing to unload millions of dollars to beat Ruben. 
And not with control of the Senate and the White House on the line. 
So please, please, please. If you can make a donation of $5 or of any amount at all. Chip it in.

   Team, we are
   just one month until Election Day and ballots begin being mailed to voters
   TODAY. Here’s where things stand right now:
     * Recent polls show between 20-25% of voters are still undecided. 
     * A poll from late last week shows us tied for second place with our
       Republican opponent. In California’s primary, the top two candidates,
       regardless of party, advance to the general. We’re at risk of being
       pushed out of the general election because of this celebrity
       Republican.
     * We’re running TV and digital ads, planning events across the state,
       and mobilizing our supporters. But we’re being outspent every single
       day by another candidate in this race.
   Right now we have more money going out the door than we have coming in.
   It’s our most critical time to reach voters, and because I don’t take
   corporate PAC or federal lobbyist money, I really count on supporters like
   you. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240205-1?refcode=em20240205-37313&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37313_10298894_D-3tZt&akid=37313%2E10298894%2ED-3tZt ]Can you make a donation of $5 today?

Jenga , 
Right now, Democrats are working OVERTIME to compromise the integrity of our 
elections.
While Republicans across the country are promoting common-sense measures like 
Voter ID's, the Left is shutting them down at every turn.
It’s absolutely wild: you need an ID to buy a beer, drive a car, get on a 
flight, and so much more - but somehow, you don’t need one to decide the future 
of our country.
As your Senator, I will do EVERYTHING I can to protect the democracy I fought 
for. But first, I need your help to get to Washington.

Elections are the foundation of our democracy, and we MUST do everything we

=========================================Friend – Sen. Jacky Rosen is the most vulnerable Democratic woman in the Senate, and her GOP opponent is doing everything he can to defeat her. 
Here's what we're up against: A shady MAGA billionaire recently poured $2 million into a super PAC for Jacky's Republican opponent, who just set a brand-new fundraising record of his own. They’re going to use that war chest to try to deceive Nevada voters and flip this battleground state red. 
Unlike her opponent, Jacky doesn't have GOP billionaires lurking in the shadows and bankrolling her campaign. She has something better: this grassroots team. 
We're counting on everyone reading this email to chip in $5, $28 – what most people are giving! – or whatever you can spare right now to help Jacky defend this Senate seat and keep Nevada blue.
So please, rush $5 now to help Jacky reach tonight's end-of-month goal, fuel our grassroots movement to victory, and defend our Democratic Senate majority!

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

=========================================Dear friend​​​​​​​,
I’m so excited and deeply proud to announce that Congresswoman Barbara Lee has endorsed my campaign to succeed her in California’s 12th Congressional District. 
https://barbaraleeforca.com?refcode=jtk1033-fr-text
Congresswoman Lee has been an unwavering force of inspiration and a voice of moral clarity throughout her career in the California State Legislature and her 25 years of service for this district in Congress. Her tireless dedication to the people of CA-12 and her fearless advocacy for justice, equality, and compassion have set the standard for public service and paved the way for future leaders to follow.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-simon-bu?refcode=jtk1033-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Congresswoman Lee has not only been a voice for the people but a symbol of hope and empowerment. Her commitment to uplifting the voices of the underrepresented and her unwavering strength in doing what’s right, even when it wasn’t popular, has inspired so many of us into a life of public service.
The responsibility of stepping into the shoes of such a trailblazer is not lost on me. Congresswoman Lee's endorsement is an acknowledgment of the potential for positive change that our campaign represents. It is a testament to our shared vision for a better future for our district and one that can continue the legacy she and Congressman Ron Dellums built.
I am humbled by the trust placed in our campaign, and I am fully prepared for the challenges that come with filling the big shoes left by Congresswoman Lee. 
With your support, we can continue the legacy of leading on the toughest issues we face for which CA-12 has been known. Will you contribute today to our campaigns?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-simon-bu?refcode=jtk1033-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
I invite you to join us on this journey as we work together to build a brighter future for our community. Thank you for being a part of this incredible moment. Let's continue to make history together!
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-simon-bu?refcode=jtk1033-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Onwards,
Lateefah Simon

Dear friend,
I’m so excited and deeply proud to announce that Congresswoman Barbara Lee has endorsed my campaign to succeed her in California’s 12th Congressional District. 
Congresswoman Lee has been an unwavering force of inspiration and a voice of moral clarity throughout her career in the California State Legislature and her 25 years of service for this district in Congress. Her tireless dedication to the people of CA-12 and her fearless advocacy for justice, equality, and compassion have set the standard for public service and paved the way for future leaders to follow.
Support our campaigns today!
Congresswoman Lee has not only been a voice for the people but a symbol of hope and empowerment. Her commitment to uplifting the voices of the underrepresented and her unwavering strength in doing what’s right, even when it wasn’t popular, has inspired so many of us into a life of public service.
The responsibility of stepping into the shoes of such a trailblazer is not lost on me. Congresswoman Lee's endorsement is an acknowledgment of the potential for positive change that our campaign represents. It is a testament to our shared vision for a better future for our district and one that can continue the legacy she and Congressman Ron Dellums built.
I am humbled by the trust placed in our campaign, and I am fully prepared for the challenges that come with filling the big shoes left by Congresswoman Lee. 
With your support, we can continue the legacy of leading on the toughest issues we face for which CA-12 has been known. Will you contribute today to our campaigns?
I invite you to join us on this journey as we work together to build a brighter future for our community. Thank you for being a part of this incredible moment. Let's continue to make history together!
Onwards,
Lateefah Simon
Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Friend, I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand:
✅ CNN called Ted Cruz the No. 1 Republican Senate seat most likely to flip in 2024!
🗳️ The latest poll shows me statistically tied with Ted Cruz, with 11% of Texas voters still undecided – so this race will all come down to every. single. vote. 
🚨 Ted Cruz is sounding the alarm bells – and his extremist donors are lining up to help keep him in the Senate.
I know that we can win this race. But Ted Cruz has an army of ultrawealthy donors powering his campaign, and Republicans will do everything they can to defeat us.
Please, I count on your $5 and $25 donations to keep my campaign running. Can you chip in right now so I have the money we need to win in Texas and defeat Ted Cruz? →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================   Hey, I wanted to personally reach out with an update on
   our campaign. We’re currently running TV ads in four
   different media markets—Los Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose,
   Sacramento, and San Diego.
   We’re also running a wide variety of digital ads, in both Spanish and
   English, all across the state. Voters are learning more about our plan to
   shake up the Senate on Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Snapchat and more. In
   a year where Americans are increasingly retreating to different corners of
   the internet, your resources are helping us connect with people of all
   ages and backgrounds.
   Running these ads is critical, because recent polls show this as a tight
   race. I’m neck and neck with Republican celebrity Steve Garvey for second
   place. And in this race, second place matters quite a bit.
   The top two vote-getters in March’s primary, regardless of party, advance
   to the General Election. Polling shows I’m in a very strong position to
   win the general election, regardless of who the other candidate is. But
   right now we’re at real risk of being pushed out.
   That means my time in Congress would come to an end.
   I need your help to make
   sure that doesn’t happen. Truthfully, to win we need to be running ads in
   additional media markets—my opponent is already running TV ads in places
   we aren’t, like Palm Springs. I’m the only candidate in this race who has
   never taken money from corporate PACs and doesn’t take money from federal
   lobbyists, so I truly count on you.
   With that in mind, can you please make your first donation to our
   senate campaign of $5 today? Here’s a link:
   [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240131-2?refcode=em20240131-37159&refcode2=37159_10298894_TtDMaV&akid=37159%2E10298894%2ETtDMaV ]https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240131-2

=========================================Friend, we're officially in the full swing of the election year. And I'm all in to protect my battleground seat in Nevada so I can keep up the fight for affordable health care, reproductive freedom, and the issues that matter most to working families. But I need people like you by my side to win.
Here's why: CNN ranks me as the most vulnerable woman in the Senate, which is why Mitch McConnell has personally recruited a far-right Republican to defeat me. And polling already shows me locked in dead heat with my GOP opponent – in the race that will likely decide Senate control.
If I'm going to fight back and defeat the GOP here in Nevada, it's critical that we show the full strength of this grassroots team right from the start. That's why I have a personal request for you, friend:
I'm looking for 100,000 people to step up and become Election Year Founding Donors by midnight tonight, and I'm counting on you to be one of them. Please, will you chip in $5 or more now to help me keep Nevada and the Senate blue?

Rosen for Nevada - 2024 Election Year Founding Donor
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_january_2024?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode=jtk3413-fr-text
In Nevada's last Senate race, the GOP spent MILLIONS and came within less than a percentage point. Now, they know that the path to Senate control once again goes right through Nevada, so they're doing whatever it takes to finally flip this battleground red.
Already, a shady MAGA billionaire dumped $2 MILLION into this race to prop up McConnell's handpicked candidate, and we know this is just the beginning. That's why we're on a mission to build the strongest grassroots team possible – as early as possible – to fight back and defend this seat.
So please, I'm counting on your immediate grassroots support: Will you give $5 or more now to become an Election Year Founding Donor, power this reelection campaign to victory in Nevada, and defend our Democratic Senate majority?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_january_2024?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode=jtk3413-fr-text
Thank you. Having you by my side means everything to me.

Friend, we're officially in the full swing of the election year. And I'm all in to protect my battleground seat in Nevada so I can keep up the fight for affordable health care, reproductive freedom, and the issues that matter most to working families. But I need people like you by my side to win.
Here's why: CNN ranks me as the most vulnerable woman in the Senate, which is why Mitch McConnell has personally recruited a far-right Republican to defeat me. And polling already shows me locked in dead heat with my GOP opponent – in the race that will likely decide Senate control.
If I'm going to fight back and defeat the GOP here in Nevada, it's critical that we show the full strength of this grassroots team right from the start. That's why I have a personal request for you, friend:
I'm looking for 100,000 people to step up and become Election Year Founding Donors by midnight tonight, and I'm counting on you to be one of them. Please, will you chip in $5 or more now to help me keep Nevada and the Senate blue?
In Nevada's last Senate race, the GOP spent MILLIONS and came within less than a percentage point. Now, they know that the path to Senate control once again goes right through Nevada, so they're doing whatever it takes to finally flip this battleground red.
Already, a shady MAGA billionaire dumped $2 MILLION into this race to prop up McConnell's handpicked candidate, and we know this is just the beginning. That's why we're on a mission to build the strongest grassroots team possible – as early as possible – to fight back and defend this seat.
So please, I'm counting on your immediate grassroots support: Will you give $5 or more now to become an Election Year Founding Donor, power this reelection campaign to victory in Nevada, and defend our Democratic Senate majority?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Thank you. Having you by my side means everything to me.

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
									Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

=========================================Friend, I want you to hear this directly from me: Right now, I'm coming up short of my end-of-month fundraising goal. I'm running low on options and I need your help. 
The most recent polling shows this race is wide open, with a large number of voters still undecided. The pundits are saying we have a path – as long as we reach our voters and galvanize our base. I'm at a serious fundraising deficit compared to my opponents and I need every dollar to close this gap. We're picking up steam, but with every day I don't hit my goal, I have to raise twice as much the next day to catch up.
Running a campaign in California is expensive – and political experts are saying this could be the most competitive Senate race in U.S. history. With two other candidates in this race sitting on millions, missing my goal could spell disaster for this campaign.
Grassroots supporters like you are propelling this campaign to monumental heights. And this grassroots team is the reason political pundits across the board are saying this race is wide open. 
So here I am, writing to you again, friend. I know you hear a lot from me, but it's only because I trust you and believe that I can't do this without you. Please, if you can spare any donation before my end-of-month deadline in 2 days to close our fundraising gap, it would mean the world to me.

Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

   funded by big corporate interests have rigged the rules against families,
   making it difficult to get ahead. The elected leaders we send to
   Washington must be accountable to the people they represent, and they must
   prove to voters that democracy can work for them. That’s why I’m running
   for the Senate, and I want you on my team.

Hey, it’s Katie Porter. You may know me as the woman who brings a whiteboard to congressional hearings, taking corrupt Republicans and greedy CEOs to task.
Now, I’m running for the U.S. Senate, and our primary is just around the corner on March 5th, 2024.
I’m running because “better than the way things were” isn’t good enough.
It’s not “good enough” that huge corporations are making record profits while more and more families can’t afford necessities. 
It’s not “good enough” that my kids had to ask me if they were safe at school after a shooting in a nearby church.
It’s not “good enough” that extremist politicians could ban abortion nationwide if they win just a few more Senate seats. 
Our country isn’t working for the majority of working people. Republicans funded by big corporate interests have rigged the rules against families, making it difficult to get ahead. The elected leaders we send to Washington must be accountable to the people they represent, and they must prove to voters that democracy can work for them. That’s why I’m running for the Senate, and I want you on my team. 
I’m proud to be the only candidate in this race who has never taken corporate PAC money and is rejecting federal lobbyist money. That means I rely on supporters like you chipping in. Can you make a donation of $5 today?

Jenga , I’ve worked on a couple of political races in my day, and I have a 
pretty good nose for sniffing out who has a chance in tough elections.
 That’s why I can tell you with 100% certainty that CAPT Hung Cao is the ONLY 
candidate in Virginia who can beat Tim Kaine and take back the Senate.
Hung is the only person in this race who isn’t a career politician.
He didn't spend his life sitting at a desk and taking three-martini lunches 
with lobbyists -Hung spent 25 years fighting for our country as a U.S. Navy 
Captain.
 He took on terrorists face to face and risked his life to defend our country.
I’ve talked to so many voters during the course of this campaign, and I always 
hear the same thing: they’re sick and tired of business as usual in Washington.
 Hung is the leader we need to shake up the swamp, but with Tim Kaine and the 
Democrat Virginia machine raising MILLIONS to silence him, we need your urgent 
help to fight back. Can you pitch in now?

=========================================I’m running to replace Kevin Cramer in the Senate and fight for working and middle-class Americans because I know what it’s like to struggle.
But first I have to compete with the special interest donors Cramer has lined up to flood this race with millions to defend his seat. I’m counting on 200 gifts before midnight to help me build the resources I need to win this race, defeat Cramer, and help Democrats hold the Senate Majority. Will you chip in $15 right now to help keep my grassroots campaign fully funded? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240202_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]
I don’t come from money.
I grew up in a family that struggled to get by in rural America.
We counted on food stamps to put dinner on the table.
We counted on government-funded programs, like Headstart for Preschool.
So believe me when I say I know what it’s like to struggle.
I know what it’s like to wonder where your next meal is coming from.
I know what it’s like to live on a fixed income.
But I’m up against Republican Kevin Cramer who has only voted to slash funding from federal programs struggling families rely on and funnel special interest cash into his campaign coffers.
I will never forget where I came from or who I am fighting for in the Senate. But first, I have to compete with Cramer’s millionaire and billionaire mega-donors. I’m not taking a dime of Corporate PAC money – so to fund this groundbreaking campaign, I’m counting on your help. I need 200 gifts before midnight to build an unstoppable foundation of support, win this competitive race, and finally send Cramer packing for good. Will you chip in $15 before midnight? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240202_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]
I know this race may seem like an uphill battle.
But until 2018, this seat was a Democratic stronghold for almost six decades.
The truth is: This race is one of Democrats’ best chances in the entire country to flip a Senate seat from red to blue – but ONLY if we have the resources to get my message to every undecided voter in the state.
That’s why I’m counting on 200 gifts before midnight to keep my campaign fully funded, FLIP this seat for Democrats, and fight for hardworking families. Will you stand with me and chip in any amount before midnight? Nothing would make a bigger impact in my campaign to OUST Republican Senator Kevin Cramer than a small contribution on your part. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240202_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]

=========================================Here's the deal, Jenga.
In less than 36 hours, our campaign will face its next end-of-month deadline – the biggest so far because my self-funding opponents are spending millions to defeat me and one just raised nearly $350,000 at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser!
As one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection, I can't stress enough how important your support is in this critical moment.

Here's the deal, Jenga.
In less than 36 hours, our campaign will face its next end-of-month deadline – the biggest so far because my self-funding opponents are spending millions to defeat me and one just raised nearly $350,000 at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser!
									As one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection, I can't stress enough how important your support is in this critical moment.

=========================================Jenga, it's Emily, Kirsten's digital director. I'll get straight to the point here: Kirsten is up against her very first end-of-month deadline of 2024, and she's pacing dangerously behind her $50,000 goal. 
This is the final time I'll ask: Please, before midnight tonight, will you chip in $5 or whatever you can spare to help Kirsten hit this critical goal and defend her must-win seat?
Kirsten has been working around the clock to deliver results for families:
* She secured critical legislation to crack down on gun trafficking — and this bill is already getting dangerous weapons off our streets.
* She's fighting to finally certify the Equal Rights Amendment and pass guaranteed nationwide paid family leave.
* She's continuing to lead the fight to increase government transparency, ban members of Congress from trading stocks and end corruption.
* She's released a Strategic Plan on Aging to protect Social Security and Medicare while ensuring that seniors can retire with dignity and comfort.
* She celebrated historic wins in military justice reform while continuing her tireless advocacy for service members and veterans.
* And she's continuing to work night and day to create more good-paying jobs, increase access to education and lower the cost of health care.
With so many critical fights ahead of us, we need Kirsten's bold, relentless voice in the Senate. But the GOP is directly targeting her seat for defeat! We must show a strong base of grassroots support to make it clear to the GOP isn't up for grabs. And right now, we're on track to fall short of Kirsten's very first end-of-month goal of 2024!
Please, Kirsten is counting on a surge in grassroots donations before her midnight deadline tonight. Will you rush $5 or more right now to help Kirsten hit this critical goal and start 2024 off on a strong foot?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

   Jenga — Wisconsin
   is going to be one of the most hotly-contested states this November, with
   toss-up Senate and presidential elections on the ballot.
   Wisconsin elections are won and lost by the narrowest of margins — with

=========================================My critical end-of-month fundraising deadline is tonight, and we still haven't hit our $500,000 goal. We're still $14,728 short.
Is there anything I can say that would convince you to donate? →

What if I told you that the latest poll shows me statistically tied with Ted Cruz, with 11% of voters still undecided? CNN is saying this is one of the most competitive Senate races in the country, and top political experts officially named Texas a battleground because of this campaign.
I can't stress enough how important it is for Ted Cruz to see the true power of this grassroots movement. 
And with your help, we can send Ted and the entire GOP running scared. 
So please: Can you chip in any amount before 11:59 p.m. tonight to make sure I hit this important goal and can defeat Ted Cruz? I'll be forever grateful →

What if I told you that the latest poll shows me statistically tied with Ted Cruz, with 11% of voters still undecided? CNN is saying this is one of the most competitive Senate races in the country, and top political experts officially named Texas a battleground because of this campaign.
I can't stress enough how important it is for Ted Cruz to see the true power of this grassroots movement.
And with your help, we can send Ted and the entire GOP running scared. 
So please: Can you chip in any amount before 11:59 p.m. tonight to make sure I hit this important goal and can defeat Ted Cruz? I'll be forever grateful →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================I don’t come from money.
My parents taught me to work hard for every dollar you earn.
They also taught me that there’s no shame in asking for help when you need it.
So I’m reaching out to folks from your area to ask for support. My first End of Month Deadline of 2024 is only 72 hours away – but I’m still running $5,000 short. I’m going to explain why this deadline is so critical, but if you’re in a rush please chip in $15 now. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240128_em_fr_b1_nkatrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]
Unlike a lot of people who run for office, I know what it’s like to struggle financially.
I grew up in poverty, but my parents never stopped fighting to create a better life for us.
I know the choices everyday Americans face.
I understand the pressures of living without a safety net.
So when my Republican Senator, Kevin Cramer, voted against lowering prescription drug prices, instead of supporting hardworking families:
I said, ‘Enough.’
I know that if we want to see change, we need more regular people like me in the Senate.
But the truth is: Running for office is incredibly expensive.
Hitting the first End of Month Deadline of the new year could be the difference between funding a winning campaign, or struggling to keep up. So I’m personally asking: Will you chip in $15 now? I don’t take any Corporate PAC money, so my campaign is powered by regular folks chipping in a few bucks at a time. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240128_em_fr_b1_nkatrina_30_cl_rs&amount=15]
After my End of Month Deadline hits in 72 hours, everyone will be watching to see if my campaign is strong enough to flip this seat blue.
I’m behind right now. But I know that if we all band together, we can defy the odds and win this race for everyday folks across the country. Can I count on your $15 to help me get there?

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

Katrina Christiansen is tired of career politicians who put special interest cash above the needs of hardworking families. That’s why she’s running for U.S. Senate to ensure no family has to choose between paying for essential medication and putting food on the table.
						Katrina doesn’t take a penny of Corporate PAC money, so she’s relying on support from grassroots donors to fund her campaign and compete with Republicans’ deep pockets. Will you chip in any amount before midnight to help Katrina defeat Republican special interests and flip this seat for everyday North Dakotans?

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.
									Thank you!

=========================================Hi everyone,
As we step into Black History Month, I want to tell you the story of a soda fountain in the segregated South before 1964.
At that time, barely fifty years ago, Black customers weren’t even allowed to sit in the same seats as white customers. Thanks to heroes like Dr. King and Fannie Lou Hamer, change was slowly spreading across America. But change hadn’t yet come to many small southern towns.
Even the seats at the soda fountain were still segregated — until one worker decided he was tired of waiting for that to change. He thought that if his Black customers weren’t allowed to sit, then nobody should be, and he removed every single seat in that shop.
Until everyone could sit as equals, they’d all just have to stand.
The man who removed those seats was my Dad, and I think about what he did often. Dad believed we all have a role to play in making change for the benefit of all, and by removing those seats, he found a common-sense solution to address an injustice.
**Photo of Tammy Murphy and her father after Tammy's college graduation. Tammy is in a cap and gown holding a diploma, and her dad is beaming with pride.**
Fifty years later, we’ve come a long way from the days of segregation, but we have a long way to go still. Systemic racism lives on, and we all have a role to play in fighting back against it.
It’s why I made combating racial disparities in maternal and infant health the key issue of my time as First Lady, and it’s driving my campaign for the U.S. Senate today.
This month, let’s celebrate men and women like Dr. King, Fannie Lou Hamer, John Lewis, and so many more, who have helped us come so far. But let’s not stop there. Let’s ask ourselves what small things we can do to make our communities fairer and safer for everyone.
For my Dad, it was removing the seats at the segregated soda fountain.
What will it be for you?
Together,
Tammy Murphy

=========================================Colin Allred for Senate
Hey, friend, it's Lauren (Colin’s Finance Director), and I wanted to show you my quick convo with Colin: 
Colin: "Hey, how are things looking for our EOM deadline?"
Lauren: "We still need to raise $164,000 to hit our goal."
Colin: "Yikes, we still have a long way to go with just two days left."
Lauren: "I'll reach out to your top supporters now."
I hate giving Colin bad news. Not just because I hate to disappoint him – but because every missed goal means that we could fall short in our efforts to knock enough doors, make enough calls, and buy enough airtime to reach the undecided voters we need to win – and we risk falling so far behind that we never recover.
So with our very first end-of-month deadline of the year approaching in just two days, I need your help: Will you make sure I don't have to give Colin any more bad news? Please, rush $5 right now so that we can hit our $500,000 goal and continue to reach the critical voters we need on their TVs, online, and at their doors. →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================Friend, Californians start early voting TODAY – and the latest polls show that nearly 20% of California voters are still undecided. That's why we're reaching out to ask for your urgent support.
Can you chip in for my campaign for the United States Senate?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1025-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Please, will you rush $5 to Barbara Lee's Senate campaign now so she can get out the vote in these final days?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1025-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Friend, by now, I'm sure you've heard: Barbara Lee's opponents are spending MILLIONS on TV ads. And to be brutally honest with you, we don't have the resources to compete with them for TV airspace. 
But we don't need to – because this race will be won on the ground, not on TV.
That's why, here at Team Lee, we're focusing all of our resources on our voter outreach efforts. We're knocking on more doors, calling up more voters and traveling to even the most remote towns to spread Barbara Lee's vision for progress across the state. And according to our internal polling, these efforts are working.
So, as this race tightens even further, we're ramping up these efforts as much as possible – but we need your help funding this work. Friend, with Californians casting their votes right now, today and every day until election day will determine the outcome of this race. 
Please, will you donate whatever you can spare to Barbara Lee's campaign now to help send her to the Senate?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1025-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Thank you. Now, let's go show the wealthy elites that we can build a successful campaign from the ground up!
– Team Lee

									– Team Lee
Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================7,988,132. That's how many registered voters there were in Ohio as of Election Day 2023.
3,964,530. That's how many of them cast a ballot.
That's LESS THAN HALF, Jenga! 
This battleground race is neck and neck right now, which means winning (or losing!) could easily come down to voter turnout. To make sure we have the resources to reach, register, and turn out every Democratic voter, we have one more number to share:
$5. That's what we're asking you to contribute right now.
Your $5, combined with the $5 and $25 donations of thousands of other grassroots donors, is how we're going to reach our $250,000 end-of-month goal by midnight tomorrow. 
It's how we're going to get ads on the air, run phone banks, and knock on doors so we can reach Ohioans in every corner of the state and make sure they vote on Election Day.
It's how we're going to fight back against Sherrod Brown's self-funding millionaire opponents, defend Ohio's critical seat, and defend our Senate majority.
So please, can you rush just $5 to make a critical difference and help turn out the vote in one of the most important Senate races in the country? We're counting on YOU to help us keep the Senate blue.

									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you.

=========================================Friend:
Early voting began yesterday morning in California, which means that folks are already casting their votes for who will represent them in the Senate for the next term. And with approximately 20% of voters still undecided, this is still anyone's race. 
These next 28 days are the ones that will determine the outcome of this race. That's why I'm investing heavily in meeting voters where they are so we can get out the vote, but I need your help to expand these efforts.
So please, while Californians continue to cast their ballots, will you rush $5 or more now to help me reach more voters in these final 28 days?

Friend:
Early voting began yesterday morning in California, which means that folks are already casting their votes for who will represent them in the Senate for the next term. And with approximately 20% of voters still undecided, this is still anyone's race.
These next 28 days are the ones that will determine the outcome of this race. That's why I'm investing heavily in meeting voters where they are so we can get out the vote, but I need your help to expand these efforts.
So please, while Californians continue to cast their ballots, will you rush $5 or more now to help me reach more voters in these final 28 days?
Contribute
Thank you.
									– Barbara
Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

   This worries us for a few reasons.
   First, national Republicans are going to see this poll and zero in on
   Pennsylvania. Bob Casey’s mega-millionaire opponent already has the
   backing of the entire GOP war chest, and this news will invite even more
   dark money into this race. 
   Second, political experts predict that Pennsylvania could decide control
   of the Senate and the White House. With everything from the fate of our
   democracy to reproductive rights at risk, we can’t afford to fall behind.

We’ll cut right to the chase, Jenga: A recent poll shows this race tightening.
Donate ››
This worries us for a few reasons.
First, national Republicans are going to see this poll and zero in on Pennsylvania. Bob Casey’s mega-millionaire opponent already has the backing of the entire GOP war chest, and this news will invite even more dark money into this race. 
Second, political experts predict that Pennsylvania could decide control of the Senate and the White House. With everything from the fate of our democracy to reproductive rights at risk, we can’t afford to fall behind.
We hope you understand how high the stakes are this November. That’s why we’re turning to you, Jenga: Will you pitch in $5 or more right now to help us win this thing?

   Not everyone opens these messages, and even fewer people read them all the

   difference.

   I’m so proud of the campaign we’ve built together,
   Jenga.
   From launching this campaign last year on January 6 to calling out Josh
   Hawley on cable news to breaking Missouri fundraising records quarter
   after quarter, your support has helped us put a national spotlight on this
   U.S. Senate race.
   And now, multiple polls are showing that we’re in a neck-and-neck race
   with Josh Hawley — the GOP’s most unpopular U.S. Senator running in 2024.

   home.
   I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family
   lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart
   condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no
   money left, times had never been tougher.
   But we weren’t alone — our community took care of us. When my parents had
   to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends
   took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the
   house than we could ever hope to eat. That’s the Missouri I grew up in.

   Their support helped send me to college, and after that I joined the
   Marines to honor everything they had done for me and my family growing up.
   Got deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Later the Pentagon. I was on the
   Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia.
   When I came home between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest
   things was seeing what was happening back in my old neighborhood. It was a
   community picked for parts — the local corner store boarded up, my first
   family house bulldozed to the ground. Here’s all that’s left of it:
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43366?refcode=em20240206-4761&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4761%2E1040133%2EmUN-pe Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1005 ]The empty lot where Lucas' childhood home once stood.
   While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah,
   Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country
   waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies
   for the industries that stripped our communities for parts — like Wall
   Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil — and then told us they can’t figure out
   how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and
   investing in our own people.
   I saw what was happening — and I was ready to fight back.
   So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate
   defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an
   organization that fights corporate monopolies — we took on defense
   contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying
   off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind.
   And now, I’m running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and
   fundamentally change who has power in our country — so everyday people
   call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to
   abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war
   profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a
   Marshall Plan for the Midwest — a massive investment and job creation
   program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil
   fuels once and for all.
   I want to codify Roe v. Wade, secure voting rights, and ban anti-union
   “Right-to-Work” scams forever. I want to put working people in charge of
   our country. But I need your help to get it done.
   Without a single cent of corporate PAC money, we’re building the
   people-powered movement that’s going to defeat Josh Hawley and flip this
   Senate seat — and I need you on our team.

   I’m not just running to make a point — this is a race we can win.
   Josh Hawley is vulnerable. In 2018, he won his seat with only 51% of the
   vote — and after he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January
   6th, he became the least popular Republican Senator up for re-election in
   2024.

   Since Hawley was elected, Missourians have broken with him and taken back
   their power at the ballot box by voting to raise the minimum wage, expand
   Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, and legalize cannabis.
   And if we’re able to communicate to voters early in this race that our
   campaign is about taking this U.S. Senate seat back for real Missourians,
   we have a real shot at defeating Josh Hawley.
   But I need you on this team to get it done,
   Jenga. GOP insiders and even Hawley’s own
   campaign have already started attacking me — and over the coming months,
   they’re bound to get even more vicious. That’s why we need to start

I’m so proud of the campaign we’ve built together, Jenga.
From launching this campaign last year on January 6 to calling out Josh Hawley on cable news to breaking Missouri fundraising records quarter after quarter, your support has helped us put a national spotlight on this U.S. Senate race.
And now, multiple polls are showing that we’re in a neck-and-neck race with Josh Hawley — the GOP’s most unpopular U.S. Senator running in 2024.
In a moment, I’m going to ask you to add your first donation of any amount toward my campaign to defeat Hawley and flip Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat. But first, please let me share a little more about how we got here.
ADD A DONATION NOW →
I grew up in mid-Missouri. And like so many other Americans, my family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. So when my little sister was born with a heart condition, the medical bills bankrupted us. Maxed-out credit cards and no money left, times had never been tougher.
But we weren’t alone — our community took care of us. When my parents had to take my sister to the hospital in St. Louis, our neighbors and friends took my siblings and me into their homes and brought more meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat. That’s the Missouri I grew up in.
Their support helped send me to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything they had done for me and my family growing up. Got deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Later the Pentagon. I was on the Joint Staff negotiating arms control agreements with NATO and Russia.
When I came home between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the hardest things was seeing what was happening back in my old neighborhood. It was a community picked for parts — the local corner store boarded up, my first family house bulldozed to the ground. Here’s all that’s left of it:
While all of us were risking our lives building up towns like Habbaniyah, Fallujah, and Herat, career politicians like Josh Hawley let our country waste away. They spent trillions on bailouts, tax breaks, and subsidies for the industries that stripped our communities for parts — like Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil — and then told us they can’t figure out how to invest even a fraction of that into building up our own country and investing in our own people.
I saw what was happening — and I was ready to fight back.
So in my final year of active duty, I worked to upend the corporate defense monopolies that leave our country less safe. I also joined an organization that fights corporate monopolies — we took on defense contractors, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Ag, Wall Street. The people buying off our politicians and leaving the rest of us behind.
And now, I’m running for U.S. Senate to replace Josh Hawley and fundamentally change who has power in our country — so everyday people call the shots, not massive corporations or corrupt politicians. I want to abolish corporate PACs, expose lobbyists writing our laws, criminalize war profiteering, ban insider trading among members of Congress, and enact a Marshall Plan for the Midwest — a massive investment and job creation program that will rebuild our forgotten communities and get us off fossil fuels once and for all.
I want to codify Roe v. Wade, secure voting rights, and ban anti-union “Right-to-Work” scams forever. I want to put working people in charge of our country. But I need your help to get it done.
Without a single cent of corporate PAC money, we’re building the people-powered movement that’s going to defeat Josh Hawley and flip this Senate seat — and I need you on our team. Please add a donation of any amount right now so we can continue building this movement and finally give power back to everyday, working people.

I’m not just running to make a point — this is a race we can win.
Josh Hawley is vulnerable. In 2018, he won his seat with only 51% of the vote — and after he exposed himself to be a fraud and a coward on January 6th, he became the least popular Republican Senator up for re-election in 2024.
Since Hawley was elected, Missourians have broken with him and taken back their power at the ballot box by voting to raise the minimum wage, expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, and legalize cannabis.
And if we’re able to communicate to voters early in this race that our campaign is about taking this U.S. Senate seat back for real Missourians, we have a real shot at defeating Josh Hawley.
But I need you on this team to get it done, Jenga. GOP insiders and even Hawley’s own campaign have already started attacking me — and over the coming months, they’re bound to get even more vicious. That’s why we need to start preparing right now to fight back and deliver our positive message to voters.
Will you chip in anything you can right now so we can keep building this record-breaking grassroots movement and stay prepared for the fight ahead? I don’t take a cent from corporate PACs, so I mean it when I say anything makes a big difference to our campaign.

=========================================Hi there, Jenga. I was just about to send my daily update on where we're tracking toward our January fundraising goal to Sherrod, but, well, I triple-checked the numbers, and right now, we're not on track to reach it. 
I know we ask for your help often, but I really don't want to have to send this bad news to Sherrod, so I'm asking again now: If we can raise $15,000 in the next 30 minutes, we'll get back on track – so please, will you chip in $5 or more to help us get there?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1160-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
In a race this close, every goal really is make or break, Jenga. Polls show Sherrod is neck and neck with his GOP opponents, and CNN is calling Ohio one of Republicans' best pickup opportunities. With our Senate majority on the line, we're counting on grassroots support from folks like you to pull ahead and win.
So please, will you donate $5, $25 – everything you can spare – to help Sherrod win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue? Every dollar could be the difference between winning and losing this battleground race.

   Jenga — Tammy
   needs your support now more than ever. Here’s a quick rundown of why:
   FIRST: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin announced he’s not running for
   reelection, which effectively means Republicans only need to flip one more
   seat to take back the Senate majority.
   THEN: Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans threw their support behind
   Tammy’s soon-to-be opponent, California megamillionaire Eric Hovde — who’s
   ready to self-fund his campaign with at least $20 million of his own
   personal fortune.
   NOW: We need your help to fight back so we can reelect Tammy and defend
   our razor-thin Democratic Senate majority.

=========================================Honestly, friend? I'm starting to get a little worried: With only hours left before midnight, we're still short of our $25,000 daily fundraising goal.
The latest polls show this race is still up for grabs, with over 20% still undecided. That means I need your immediate support to make sure we are on track to move to the General Election. You have the power to help me pull ahead in this race – but I need your help to keep the momentum going strong.
Please, friend: Will you donate $5 right now to help me hit our daily fundraising goal and fuel our progressive movement before it’s too late? >>

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

   There are
   three things we need you to know right now.
   1) Katie is currently being outspent 8:1 on TV ads. Our opponent has spent
   more than $16M on TV ads across the state, and we’re still six weeks from
   the election. We’re at risk of being drowned out on the airwaves.
   2) Katie is the only candidate in this race who has never taken a dime
   from corporate PACs, and will truly stand up to the corporate interests
   that run Washington.
   3) Because of California’s “jungle primary” system, the top two
   candidates, regardless of party, will advance from the Primary to the
   General Election. Katie is at risk of being kept out of the general
   because a celebrity Republican is surging in the polls.
   We won’t B.S. you, we’re being heavily outspent so we need your financial
   support. Our average contribution this month is just $26–so every donation
   makes a difference.

51 years after Roe v. Wade first protected women’s right to choose, it is becoming more and more dangerous to be pregnant in our country.
Too many headlines tell us how the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs has allowed pregnant women to be prosecuted for seeking abortion care and enabled states like Idaho to pass extreme abortion bans that make no exception even more medical emergencies.
The only way to protect every single American is to flip the House, expand our majority in the Senate, and reelect President Biden to make the right to an abortion federally protected.

Ever since the Dobbs decision overturned decades of precedent, voters have made it abundantly clear that they don’t support abortion bans.
This is a losing issue for Republicans, and they know it. But that won’t stop them from seeking a federal ban on abortion if they win full control of Congress.

I wanted you to know how very grateful we are at Team Emord for those of you who have donated tonight in support of the campaign!  Thank you!  You have risen to aid Emord for Senate when it needs your help most. I am amazed at your generosity.  I am also amazed at how hard Jonathan works day in and day out to let every Virginian know of legislative solutions to restore constitutional limits on government power, secure the borders, end inflation, protect our individual rights, and rev﻿italize the American economy.   Because Jonathan has written bills for members of Congress in defense of the Constitution and our constitutional rights, including the precursor to the Right to Try Act signed into law by President Trump, Jonathan will hit the ground running as soon as he gets into Congress.  He needs no on the job training.  He will introduce legislation to save Virginia and America the moment he is sworn into office. Support Jonathan Jonathan is an amazing and tireless constitutional litigator and scholar.  I wish you could see him argue in federal court, as I have.  It’s amazing!  He is a great, very skilled debater.  He outwits the best lawyers.  He will run circles around Tim Kaine.  In fact, in one case Jonathan left one of New York’s best lawyers so overwhelmed he could not articulate a responsive argument.   Jonathan is also a man of great integrity, faith, and commitment to America.  He is like a daily history lesson for our family.  He has such a rich understanding of the founding principles of our country and of constitutional law and history that the words of the founding fathers frequently flow from his lips to our ears as he recounts the teachings of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and other founders.  That he remembers their words in perfect detail is a testament not only to his intellect but also to his patriotism.  If you have heard Jonathan speak, you have seen this remarkable talent in action.   Everyone who knows Jonathan well knows he loves his country far more than himself.  He will save it from Tim Kaine and the communist agenda, but he cannot do it alone.  He needs you.  He needs us.   Our family supports his cause.  Every freedom loving American should too.  Please go on record right now with your support for Jonathan by donating generously before the deadline of midnight tonight. The deadline is now just an hour away.

   Jenga, Bob Casey is one of Mitch McConnell’s top targets.
   [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/casey-em-20240205-1?recurring=1&refcode=em20240205-1&refcode2=1900_5072169_3c8mIV&akid=1900%2E5072169%2E3c8mIV ]Let me explain what it means to be at the top of the GOP’s list. But
   first, can you chip in $5 or more to keep this seat and our
   Senate blue?
   Being a top target means that dark money super PACs are going to raise
   historic amounts of money to flip this seat — a super PAC supporting our
   opponent already raised $18 million last year, and that’s just the
   beginning. 
   It means that Mitch McConnell and his billionaire backers are ready to
   dump millions upon millions of dollars into PA to flood the airwaves and
   smear Bob’s record.
   It means that Mitch McConnell knows that if we lose in Pennsylvania, we
   have no chance of holding our razor-thin Senate majority.
   And it means that we need to meet every single fundraising goal we set to
   keep up with our mega-millionaire opponent's war chest.

   to today, can you make it Bob Casey’s? With the Senate majority hinging on
   this race, your contribution will have the biggest impact in PA.

=========================================   Friends — Trump has Arizona in his crosshairs.
He’s already endorsed the “MAGA Queen” Kari Lake, and more attack ads could come any day now. 
The MAGA-right has their candidate in Arizona, and Trump’s going to rally their donations and support for Kari Lake this Friday. 
We already know why. 
Arizona is the most important state in the country. This state will determine who wins the White House, and which party controls the Senate. And most of all — because this isn’t just politics to Trump and Lake. 
This is personal. They both lost here before, and they are coming at us with everything they’ve got. Ruben is all that stands in the way. 
We have to take this seriously, because they most certainly will. 
Can you PLEASE make a online donation to Ruben’s campaign for U.S. Senate in Arizona? Trump and Lake will stop at nothing to win, and we need to have Ruben’s back if he’s going to win this seat in November.

Friend — Trump has Arizona in his crosshairs.
He’s already endorsed the “MAGA Queen” Kari Lake, and more attack ads could come any day now. 
The MAGA-right has their candidate in Arizona, and Trump will stop at nothing to make sure she wins and Ruben loses. 
We already know why. 
Arizona is the most important state in the country. This state will determine who wins the White House, and which party controls the Senate. And most of all — because this isn’t just politics to Trump and Lake. 
This is personal. They both lost by extremely slim margins here, and they are coming at us with everything they’ve got. Ruben is all that stands in the way. 
We have to take this seriously, because they most certainly will. 
Can you PLEASE make your first online donation to Ruben’s campaign for U.S. Senate in Arizona? Trump and Lake will stop at nothing to win, and we need to have Ruben’s back if he’s going to win this seat in November.

   Most of my family is from a town called Ste. Genevieve. I’ve watched their
   community go downhill for years.
   While corrupt politicians shipped jobs overseas and voted to give handouts
   to Wall Street and their corporate allies, everyday people just trying to
   survive in the place they call home ran out of money and opportunities.
   Our leaders abandoned them — and Josh Hawley is the perfect example.
   Instead of fighting for what would make the communities in my home state
   stronger, Josh Hawley has been busy engaging in out-of-touch culture wars
   and selling us his book all about “manhood” — telling the whole world that
   the only way to be a man is to be exactly like him.
   Well… when I think about manhood, I think about courage. And that’s not
   something you can give speeches or write a book about.
   Missouri is the Show Me State. Courage is something you have to show us.
   That’s why I’m supporting Lucas Kunce for Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat. As
   a born-and-raised Missourian who joined the Marines to serve the community
   that took care of him growing up, Lucas has already shown us that he knows
   the true meaning of courage.
   Lucas knows courage is about standing up to the powerful and working to
   rebuild our state. And he knows real leaders fight to empower everyday
   people and secure our future for generations to come — not for their own
   power or profit.
   So Jenga, if you want to be
   told about manhood, some guy wrote a book about it.

   Lucas has been working hard to put Missouri’s Senate race on the map in
   2024. From calling out Josh Hawley’s blatant corruption to building a
   coalition of working people, national organizations, and local leaders —
   he is Democrats’ best chance to defeat a GOP incumbent and flip a U.S.
   Senate seat this election cycle.
   He’s building a truly grassroots campaign, without a cent from corporate
   PACs, to defeat Hawley and take back power for everyday working
   Missourians — just like my friends and family members all across the
   state.
   It has never been more important to elect a warrior for working people
   like Lucas Kunce to the U.S. Senate. [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/go/43306?refcode=em20240204-4741&firstname=Jenga&lastname=Smith&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&city=Roxbury&akid=4741%2E1040133%2EEp-3jM Crossing&state=MA&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t=1012 ]So

   It’s
   Katie Porter’s Whiteboard. 📝
   → Here’s the deal: Ballots begin being mailed to voters in just 6 days and
   Katie’s critical election is coming up fast on March 5th.
   When Congress is in session, Katie keeps me busy grilling corporate CEOs
   and Big Pharma lobbyists.
   But here’s the deal: If Katie loses the upcoming primary election, our
   time in Congress comes to an end.
   About 20% of California voters are still undecided about who they will
   vote for in the primary election on March 5. I know that Katie can win but
   we’re going to need your support to reach these undecided voters.

Katie is running for the U.S. Senate because Californians deserve a warrior fighting for them in Washington. Our campaign is people-powered, we don’t take a dime from corporate PACs, federal lobbyists, or executives from Big Oil or Big Pharma.

=========================================   Team:
The Chairman of the Republican Party of Arizona resigned earlier this week. 
He did it because Kari Lake recorded their private conversations — including an attempt to bribe her. 
He claims that she blackmailed him. 
And yesterday, Trump canceled a rally in Arizona that he had scheduled for tonight. 
Look — nobody knows what’s happening here. What’s clear is that Kari Lake brings chaos with her wherever she goes. And the LAST place she should end up is the U.S. Senate. 
But the GOP will still spend millions to send her there. That’s why we need your help.
Arizona will decide control of the Senate. It will decide the White House. And right now, we can bury them. 
Please, chip in to Ruben Gallego’s campaign for U.S. Senate.

=========================================Friend, is there ANYTHING I can say to get you to donate $5 today to keep Nevada and the Senate blue?
* What if I told you that CNN ranks incumbent Jacky Rosen as one of the most vulnerable senators in the country?
* What if I told you that Jacky’s opponent was handpicked by Mitch McConnell – and that a shady MAGA billionaire is pouring $2 million into Nevada to help Republicans buy this seat?
* What if I told you that polling shows Jacky NECK AND NECK with her GOP opponent – and the ONLY way she can get back on track to win is with your grassroots support?
There’s not much else to say on this – so please, friend: Will you donate $5 or more now to help Jacky fight back against GOP attacks, win in Nevada, and defend our Senate majority?

=========================================Friend: Donald Trump took the stage to rally his base in Nevada this weekend. It’s no secret why.
TIME magazine reports that Nevada could deliver both the White House and the Senate to Republicans this year, and polling shows Sen. Jacky Rosen in a dead heat with her extremist GOP opponent.
Please, your donation will make an important impact in this critical battleground race: Rush $5 to help Jacky win in Nevada and defend our Democratic majority!

Friend: Donald Trump took the stage to rally his base in Nevada this weekend. It’s no secret why.
TIME magazine reports that Nevada could deliver both the White House and the Senate to Republicans this year, and polling shows Sen. Jacky Rosen in a dead heat with her extremist GOP opponent.

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

   Jenga:
   Four days. That’s how long we have until the next major end-of-month
   fundraising deadline of my re-election campaign.
   Right now, I’m facing a tough re-election fight to keep delivering real
   results for Pennsylvania’s working families. 
   That's why I need your help. Mitch McConnell has put Pennsylvania on his
   list of top four seats to flip to gain a Republican Senate majority next
   year — and there's no doubt that national Republicans will spend millions
   trying to buy Pennsylvania.

   end-of-month fundraising goal. Small donations add up, and for just four

   Hi Jenga, it's
   Tammy Duckworth.
   [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/casey-em-20240201-1?refcode=em20240201-1&recurring=1&refcode2=1872_5072169_H1fngM&akid=1872%2E5072169%2EH1fngM ]I’m respectfully asking if you’ll make a contribution to support my
   friend Bob Casey’s re-election campaign. Let me tell you why.
   Bob is a fierce advocate for working families in Pennsylvania and across
   the country and, right now, he’s facing the toughest campaign of his
   career. This is going to be one of the closest Senate races of 2024, and
   the stakes couldn’t be higher.
   Mitch McConnell and national Republicans have zeroed in on Pennsylvania as
   a must-win Senate race in their mission to take back the majority. They’re
   preparing to do everything they can to regain Senate control by coming
   after Bob and flipping Pennsylvania red.
   Not only that, but Bob’s opponent, David McCormick, has the ability to
   self-fund. That means PA could see even more political spending than it
   did in 2022 — and I don’t think you need me to remind you that they spent
   a record-breaking $381 million in PA last time around.

   and defend our Democratic majority. Bob is relying on this team to have
   his back, so I hope you’ll chip in a few dollars to support him today.

   stop them $1 at a time.

   There are whole counties we aren’t able to run ads in because we just
   don’t have enough in the bank. And even in the areas where we’re both
   running ads, voters are seeing more of Adam than they are of Katie.
   With about 20% of voters still undecided, the outcome of this election
   could come down to whether or not we’re able to afford to expand our TV

We’re currently being outspent 5:1 on TV ads across California. Take a look at where Adam Schiff is running ads vs. where we are ⬇️
There are whole counties we aren’t able to run ads in because we just don’t have enough in the bank. And even in the areas where we’re both running ads, voters are seeing more of Adam than they are of Katie.
With about 20% of voters still undecided, the outcome of this election could come down to whether or not we’re able to afford to expand our TV ads.
Katie is the only candidate in this race who has never taken a dime of corporate PAC money, so we’re really counting on folks chipping in what they can.
Will you make a contribution of $5 to help us run ads across California in this final month before the primary election?

So much is at stake–we can’t lose Katie’s voice in Congress.
As always: thank you!

Katie is running for the U.S. Senate because Californians deserve a warrior fighting for them in Washington. Our campaign is people-powered, we don’t take a dime from corporate PACs, federal lobbyists, or executives from Big Oil or Big Pharma.

=========================================Jenga,
Amy is working for us in the U.S. Senate -- and she’s getting results. She led the effort to take on Big Pharma and finally end the ban on negotiating lower prescription drug prices. Now taxpayers will save billions over the next decade and many medications will be more affordable for people who rely on them.
We mean it when we say Amy’s work wouldn’t be possible without our grassroots team, which is made up of hundreds of thousands of supporters like you. We’re counting on you to stick with us because Amy will be on the ballot in November.
A $5 or $15 contribution might not seem like much. But the truth is it all adds up when everyone pitches in whatever they can. Will you donate today to help power Amy’s reelection campaign?

Jenga, the 2024 elections are getting closer and closer every day! Here's the latest on our fight to save the Senate:
FIRST:
Experts warned that Republicans have a "clear path" to retake the Senate, with a massive 23 Democratic seats on the ballot — including Kirsten's!
THEN:
Mitch McConnell's allies announced that, in 2023, they raised a RECORD-BREAKING NEARLY $95 MILLION to flip the Senate red!
NOW:
Democrats like Kirsten are calling on YOU to activate your First Quarter Democratic Membership to make sure that our candidates have the grassroots resources to defeat the GOP's megadonors this fall! 
It's going to take a massive grassroots movement to turn this around — and we're counting on you to step up before midnight tonight!

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Sen. Raphael Warnock: "Listen, I need you to chip in tonight."

Join Sen. Raphael Warnock and rush $5 or more now to help Sherrod reach our end-of-month goal, win in Ohio, and keep the Senate blue >>
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1164-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Jenga, we're facing an uphill battle here in Ohio, and experts say this race could decide Senate control. 
Polls show Sherrod neck and neck with his GOP opponents – and with the election year in full swing, they're already flooding this race with MILLIONS to turn the tides against us.
Unlike our self-funding opponents, Sherrod is running a true grassroots campaign, which means we're counting on folks like you to chip in $5 or $25 to help power us to victory. But with time running out before the end-of-month deadline, we're still falling short of our $250,000 fundraising goal.
So please, Jenga, Sen. Warnock and Sherrod are counting on you: Will you chip in $5 right now to help us reach our January fundraising goal, win in Ohio, and keep the Senate blue?

So please, Jenga, Sen. Warnock and Sherrod are counting on you: Will you chip in $5 right now to help us reach our January fundraising goal, win in Ohio, and keep the Senate blue?
Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue.

   Hi Jenga, it’s
   Jon Hamm.
   You may know me better for my role as advertising executive Don Draper on
   the show Mad Men, but today I’m writing to talk to you about Adam Schiff
   and why we need to support his run for California’s Senate seat.
   I believe that this election for California’s next U.S. Senator will shape
   the course of our democracy for many years to come.
   We need to elect someone who won’t back down from a tough fight and knows
   how to get things done.
   The twice-impeached, four-times-indicted ex-president’s recklessness and
   impulsiveness put this country in peril several times, and we must take
   him seriously as a threat to our democracy. Yet time and again, very few
   have held him accountable for his actions.
   Adam Schiff has. Again and again.
   Over the years, I’ve watched Adam do the important work to investigate
   Trump, lead the impeachment trial, and hold his feet to the fire for the
   January 6th insurrection.
   Adam has shown that he doesn’t back down from big fights. He’s defended
   our democracy and our shared values throughout his career, and he’ll keep
   up those fights in the Senate.
   But Trump and his cronies also know this,
   Jenga. That’s why they continue
   to attack Adam on television, on social media, and at their campaign
   rallies.
   Electing Adam to the U.S. Senate would be their worst nightmare — so I
   need your help to make sure that’s exactly where Adam ends up.

   Jenga?
   Will you contribute any amount to Adam’s U.S. Senate campaign today so
   that he can overcome baseless MAGA attacks, win this election, and lead
   the fight for progress in the Senate?

=========================================Friend, if you had told me playing in the NFL was a lot like working in Congress – I never would have believed you. But it prepared me more than I could have imagined.
Football is the ultimate team sport. No one wins the Super Bowl alone, and no one succeeds by being selfish. You have to learn to work with people you don’t see eye to eye with all the time, but you learn to value and respect your differences.
That’s what I do every day representing TX-32 – work with lawmakers I don’t always agree with to make progress for families in my district and all Americans. I recognize that it’s not all about me, just like football was never all about me – it’s about being a voice in Washington for the people we represent.
But Ted Cruz is selfish. He puts himself first every single chance he gets, he’s completely out of touch with what everyday Texans want and need, and he’s shown time and time again that he’s incapable of change or compromise.
I've taken down way tougher guys than Ted in the NFL, and now I'm running to defeat him because I know we deserve better – but I need your help to do it.
CNN says Ted Cruz is the most vulnerable Republican in the country, and experts have called Texas a battleground state. This is shaping up to be one of the most competitive and expensive races in the country, and I need you on my grassroots team. Please, will you chip in $5, or whatever you can spare today, to help me defeat Ted Cruz? →

									I've taken down way tougher guys than Ted in the NFL, and now I'm running to defeat him because I know we deserve better – but I need your help to do it.
CNN says Ted Cruz is the most vulnerable Republican in the country, and experts have called Texas a battleground state. This is shaping up to be one of the most competitive and expensive races in the country, and I need you on my grassroots team. Please, will you chip in $5, or whatever you can spare today, to help me defeat Ted Cruz? →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →

=========================================This race is getting loads of attention,
   Jenga, and people understand how
   important it is that we elect Angela to the U.S. Senate:

   Angela Alsobrooks is clearly the best candidate to represent Maryland in
   the Senate, Jenga,
   and this campaign is a testament to the power of thousands of grassroots
   supporters.
   That grassroots support is critical, because this is already one of the
   most competitive races in the country, and Angela’s multi-millionaire
   opponent is ready to break the bank.
    “[He] is trying to buy the seat, pouring millions of his own money into
                                   the race.”

   next U.S. Senator, we need all hands on deck. [ https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/10000?t=1003&amount=25&akid=1009%2E630668%2EoF6gld ]Can Angela count on you

   I’m reaching out today because fundraising is a necessary part of running
   a grassroots campaign, and this is our first monthly deadline of 2024.
   In short, if we don’t hit this goal, national Republicans will think this
   seat is ripe for the taking and could increase their spending tenfold.
   That means more misinformation, baseless attacks, and dark money will
   flood our state.
   With all of this in mind, I hope you don’t mind when I ask:

   today so we can close the gap on this critical deadline and show my
   opponents that this team means business?

I hope you’ll give me a few minutes to explain why your split donation today would be so impactful for my re-election campaign and Maria Cantwell’s. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc-mh-2024?amount=10]
My new multi-millionaire challenger has already flooded New Mexico’s U.S. Senate race with half a million of her personal fortune. That’s only the beginning.
She has a long career as a hedge fund executive and is the daughter of the last Republican elected to the U.S. Senate in New Mexico.
My parents weren’t politicians — my dad was a union lineman with the local utility company, and my mom was a seamstress and an automobile tire factory worker.
I was a mechanical engineer before I went into politics, not the former CFO of the largest hedge fund in the world.
I’m not in this fight to prop up Wall Street. I’m running for re-election to continue delivering meaningful change for New Mexico, like protecting reproductive rights, passing more common-sense gun safety legislation, and taking action on climate change.
But my Republican challenger already has the support of Mitch McConnell’s allies, who are dead-set on flipping New Mexico, taking back the Senate, and enacting an extreme agenda.
Will you help my team prepare to face off against a Republican opponent who has already started self-funding her campaign to defeat me? Please split $10 or any amount to my re-election campaign and Maria’s today to help put us on a path to victory: [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc-mh-2024?amount=10]

=========================================   Hey there, team. It’s Ruben. 
Wanted to reach out and thank you for putting up with a ton of emails over the past few days. We hit our goals late last night, and it isn’t lost on me that we would not have come anywhere close without you. 
So really, thanks. 
We’re going to give you a much needed break from hearing from me for the first few days of the month, but to do that we need to start February strong. 
And it’s important we do, because we just learned that Kari Lake is going to have a fundraiser with two avowed QAnon supporters tonight. These two are so extreme that even Mike Pence canceled a fundraiser with them. 
Whatever she raises with those nutjobs, we’ve got to beat it. So I’m asking you to chip in $ASK/5 today. I’m asking because we can’t let Kari Lake get the edge on us, and we definitely can't let somebody that praises election deniers and takes donations from QAnon fanatics get anywhere close to the Senate. 
I know we just came off a big push, but this is important. So please:
Can you make a donation to tell Kari Lake she’ll never step foot on the Senate floor? QAnon is a dangerous conspiracy theory, and anyone associating with them should never serve in elected office.

Hey there, team. It’s Ruben. 
Wanted to reach out and thank you for putting up with a ton of emails over the past few days. We hit our goals late last night, and it isn’t lost on me that we would not have come anywhere close without you. 
So really, thanks.  
We’re going to give you a much needed break from hearing from me for the first few days of the month, but to do that we need to start February strong.

I know we just came off a big push, but this is important. So please:
Can you make an $5 donation to tell Kari Lake she’ll never step foot on the Senate floor? QAnon is a dangerous conspiracy theory group, and anyone associating with them should never serve in elected office. 
STOP KARI LAKE

Can I tell you the story of how I first got involved in politics, friend?
While serving as the president of Nevada's largest synagogue, I was recruited to run in a competitive House race to help flip a red seat blue. Looking back, it's incredibly fitting that this was my entry point to public service – because my Judaism helps guide much of my work in the Senate today.
In fact, my decision to say "yes" and run for public office in the first place was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam – which means to leave the world a better place than how we found it.
Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I'm proud to serve Nevada and our country. And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help.
Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking:
If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you – if you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we love – will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

=========================================Jenga, 
As I was praying yesterday, something was weighing heavily on my heart.
 I was thinking of everything I am so grateful for - my family, the 
opportunity to serve the people of Missouri, the food on my table, and having a 
roof over my head.
We are blessed to live in America, Jenga – but right now, Joe Biden is making 
everyone’s life’s harder.
High Inflation is stripping Americans of their jobs and financial security.
 Our open border is forcing law-abiding Americans to fear for their lives at 
the hands of cartels and traffickers.
In cities across America, citizens are paralyzed in fear of carjackings, 
assaults, and murders because the Democrats refuse to put criminals behind bars.
I wasn’t put on this Earth to sit back while my fellow Americans suffer. 
That’s why I’m doing everything I can so we can take back our Republican Senate 
majority and get to work for the American people. 
This is a HUGE mission, and I can’t do it alone. Can you help me out by 
pitching in just $10 to help us take back our Senate majority and save America 
from the radical Left?

   Jenga, here’s what
   we DON’T want in November…
   We don’t want to let Republicans eke out a Senate majority by flipping
   Pennsylvania.
   We don’t want to let Bob’s mega-millionaire opponent get to Washington,
   where he would work to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping
   block, give tax breaks to large corporations, and roll back abortion
   rights.
   We don’t want to look back to this time of the campaign and realize that
   we didn’t do enough to raise grassroots resources, which are the only way
   we can fight back against the millions upon millions that the GOP will
   funnel into the Commonwealth this year.

Jenga, here’s what we DON’T want in November…
We don’t want to let Republicans eke out a Senate majority by flipping Pennsylvania.
We don’t want to let Bob’s mega-millionaire opponent get to Washington, where he would work to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block, give tax breaks to large corporations, and roll back abortion rights.
We don’t want to look back to this time of the campaign and realize that we didn’t do enough to raise grassroots resources, which are the only way we can fight back against the millions upon millions that the GOP will funnel into the Commonwealth this year.
$5 to Bob Casey today isn’t a huge amount, but you’ll be able to look back and know you made a difference in what will be one of the most competitive and expensive U.S. Senate races in the Nation. Can you chip in $5 now?

   When voters
   open their ballots next week, they’ll see Katie Porter’s name twice. Once
   for the normally scheduled Senate election, and again in a “special
   election” which will appoint someone to serve out a short remainder of the
   late Senator Feinstein’s term. Technically there are two elections, and
   that means contribution limits doubled. This puts our grassroots powered
   campaign at a real disadvantage.
   Our opponent has collected more than $1.2 million in money that is
   attributed to the “special election.” This is money from donors who had
   already given the maximum $6,600 that is normally allowed, but these folks
   were able to give thousands of dollars again and attribute it to the
   “special election.”
   That’s about 10x the money we have attributed to the “special election,”
   because when we say this campaign is people-powered, we mean it. Katie is
   the only candidate in this race who has never taken a dime from corporate
   PACs. She’s the only person in this race to reject federal lobbyist money.
   And she’s the only person to refuse money from Big Oil, Big Bank, and Big
   Pharma CEOs.
   Just because we’re being outraised, doesn’t mean we’re giving up. Polls
   still show that it’s possible for Katie to win this, but we really need
   your help. Our average donation this year is $26.85. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240202-1?refcode=em20240202-37223&refcode2=37223_10298894_UahiHu&akid=37223%2E10298894%2EUahiHu ]Can you match that

=========================================                          [1]U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
   We are reaching out to ask you to make a contribution to Senator Chris Murphy’s campaign. But first, will you give us a chance to explain why your contribution specifically is so important?
Chris is committed to running a true grassroots campaign because he knows that power comes from the people. Building a people-powered movement from top to bottom makes us that much more powerful and capable of making real change in Washington.
The truth is most members of Congress rake in a ton of money from corporate and special interest PACs. For his Senate colleagues, this usually adds millions of dollars for their reelection. But Chris is not taking a dime from ANY PACs.
That’s a big change from how Washington thinks we should run this campaign. He’s the first to admit that he took this money previously. But it’s not worth it to him. Special interests and corporations shouldn’t get special access, and he wants to make it 100% clear that working families always have and always will come first for him.
So this leaves a lot of money on the table, and that’s where we need you. When all of us give just a little bit, it adds up quickly. We know not everyone can contribute each time, but that’s what makes your donation that much more important.
So please:
Can you make a contribution to Chris Murphy’s reelection today? Every dollar makes a difference to our efforts to hold the Senate majority and make progressive change in Washington.

=========================================Hi team — This is Tammy’s campaign manager, Max, and I’ve been reviewing some new Rutgers polling data I think you should see.
Over ⅓ of New Jersey voters don’t know who Tammy is, yet! Another ⅓ have heard of her but haven’t formed an opinion.
We have just over five months to change that — about 150 days to show people who Tammy is and why she’s the right woman to lead New Jersey forward. But in the most crowded and expensive media market in the nation, that’s going to take a lot of resources, and fast.
Can you please chip in tonight, before our first end-of-month deadline, to ensure Tammy has the resources to reach every voter? Your donations support TV ads, online outreach, organizing, and all our other work to connect with voters.
DONATE NOW >> https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tmnj-em-q12024                            
Tammy has so many stories to tell and victories to share with the voters of New Jersey.
She played a leading role in bringing climate change curricula to our schools. She worked with doulas, patients, and health care providers to reduce deaths during childbirth — especially in Black and Brown communities — and she’s on the front lines fighting attacks on our reproductive freedom.
She’s done so much for New Jersey, and I know if we reach folks with those stories, they will turn out and vote for her.
But we're up against multiple DC insiders with deep pockets from years of politicking. They’re attacking Tammy already, and we need to reach voters before they do.
That’s why I’m calling on you now:
Please rush a donation before tomorrow’s fundraising deadline to ensure we can introduce Tammy to voters — before our opponents can attack her on TV. 
DONATE NOW >> https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tmnj-em-q12024                           
Thanks for all you do to support us. More to come soon.

   I’m a straight shooter, and I take a lot of pride in these emails being
   honest and transparent. That means telling you I could lose our race for
   the U.S. Senate.
   Two December polls show me being pushed out of the primary. That means my
   time in Congress would come to an end.
   Here’s why: California has a unique system. The top two vote-getters in
   March’s primary advance to the general election in November. Early polling
   suggests that I am in a very strong position to win the general election,
   no matter the other candidate, but the math in this primary is weird. A
   celebrity Republican is gaining traction in the polls, and he could
   advance to second place and keep us from qualifying for the general
   election.
   Election Day is less than five weeks away, but Californians begin voting
   even sooner. Ballots get mailed out next week, and with 20% of voters
   undecided, there’s no time to waste. Just a single ad—whether on TV or
   online—can change a voter's mind or inspire them to get their ballot in.
   The race between first, second, and third place will likely be decided by
   just a few percentage points. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240131-1?refcode=em20240131-37133&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37133_10298894_8Mcl5E&akid=37133%2E10298894%2E8Mcl5E ]With so little time to reach voters (and

Folks, Fox News gave free airtime to my Republican opponent Steve Garvey to attack me. Again.
Garvey is surging in the polls and stands a good chance of making the runoff in November. We have to be prepared to fight back.
Will you rush a split contribution of $5 or any amount between my campaign and Jacky Rosen’s to help us respond? We need to act fast before Garvey’s latest attack takes hold.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_schiff?refcode=jtk3387-bu-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
His campaign is already pushing this attack out far and wide after his broadside against me in the Senate debate. We need to respond.
Reaching voters across California costs millions of dollars, but with Fox News’ help, this celebrity Republican is getting free airtime to launch more false attacks against me and rile up Donald Trump’s MAGA base.
Early voting begins in less than one week, and Garvey is hoping for a flood of support from Trump voters with the Super Tuesday presidential primary on the same ballot as us.
Can you rush a split contribution of $5 or any amount between Jacky's campaign and mine to help us fight back?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_schiff?refcode=jtk3387-bu-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
The gloves are coming off, and Fox News is putting its thumb on the scale to help Republicans score an upset in this jungle primary.
We need to make sure we are prepared for the fight ahead.

=========================================Friend, I'm proud that my campaign is funded by grassroots supporters of every age, every occupation and even every state chipping in $5 and $10 at a time. Unlike some of my opponents, who rely on millionaire donors, this is truly a people-powered grassroots campaign – and we're taking this race by storm. 
That's why I'm excited to invite you to my exclusive grassroots fundraiser, hosted by myself, Gloria Steinem, Elise Joshi from Gen-Z for Change, the Collective PAC, Representation Matters and more tomorrow night. 
We’ll be emphasizing the importance of the youth vote in California and how folks from all generations are stepping up to support my campaign. And, because you have such a unique and treasured voice, I would be honored if you could join the conversation.
The virtual event will take place on Jan. 30 at 4:30 p.m. PT/7:30 p.m. ET, and I really hope to see you there, friend. You can purchase a ticket for as low as $25 (which goes straight to supporting my campaign!) here.
https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bleevirtual13024?refcode=jtk1005-ot-text
Friend, with just over 30 days to go until election day, every single donation that's made now truly matters. This entire campaign has been built on small grassroots donors like you, and now we are well poised to advance to the general election. 
But that doesn't mean that we can lose our momentum for even a single moment. I'm laser-focused on getting out the vote on the ground, but to do that, I need more resources to fund this massive grassroots operation. So I have to ask, to help me make history and bring my battle-tested progressive record to the Senate: 
Will you join me at my exclusive grassroots event tomorrow evening and help support my historic campaign? For just $25, you can buy a ticket to this event.

Thank you,

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.

We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

Team,
I wanted you to hear this directly from me:
*I am officially launching my campaign for the U.S. Senate.*

*Before I get into the details, can you chip in $10 to become a Founding
Donor of my Senate campaign? It’s going to take a huge team of grassroots
supporters to make me the first Black woman to represent Delaware in the
Senate, so please chip in:

When I think about being the first woman and first person of color to
represent Delaware in Congress, I think about my great-great-great
grandfather. In 1867, he signed a document that afforded him the right to
vote.
Fast forward to 2017, when I was being sworn in to Congress for the first
time, my sister, Thea, found the document. That document has come to
represent the importance of expanding rights and representation. It’s my
proof of where we come from and it’s my inspiration for where we need to go.
The historic nature of our campaign is not lost on me. My family and other
families of color have come so far just to be fairly represented. All the
way from being enslaved, to finally getting the right to vote, to being
elected to represent the First State.
*To make history, my team and I have set a goal to earn the support of
30,000 Founding Donors, and we’re counting on generous donors like you to
help get there. Can you rush anything right now to my campaign so we can
get the ball rolling on the race of a lifetime?

Team,
I wanted you to hear this directly from me:
I am officially launching my campaign for the U.S. Senate.
Before I get into the details, can you chip in $10 to become a Founding Donor of my Senate campaign? It’s going to take a huge team of grassroots supporters to make me the first Black woman to represent Delaware in the Senate, so please chip in:
BECOME A FOUNDING DONOR → 
When I think about being the first woman and first person of color to represent Delaware in Congress, I think about my great-great-great grandfather. In 1867, he signed a document that afforded him the right to vote.
Fast forward to 2017, when I was being sworn in to Congress for the first time, my sister, Thea, found the document. That document has come to represent the importance of expanding rights and representation. It’s my proof of where we come from and it’s my inspiration for where we need to go.
The historic nature of our campaign is not lost on me. My family and other families of color have come so far just to be fairly represented. All the way from being enslaved, to finally getting the right to vote, to being elected to represent the First State.
To make history, my team and I have set a goal to earn the support of 30,000 Founding Donors, and we’re counting on generous donors like you to help get there. Can you rush anything right now to my campaign so we can get the ball rolling on the race of a lifetime?
BECOME A FOUNDING DONOR → 
I am all in for Delaware, folks. I’ve never been more ready to continue making history as a United States Senator.
Lisa Blunt Rochester
						In 2022, Mitch McConnell's personally-aligned Super PAC spent a record-breaking $205 million on Senate Races. And that number is likely to increase in 2024!
Help us make history by sending Lisa Blunt Rochester to the Senate!

=========================================Jenga, with just 48 hours left to reach our $250,000 end-of-month goal, we're still falling critically short. This is our first major fundraising goal of the year, and missing it means we could be outraised and outspent by our GOP opponents.
Experts say this battleground race could decide Senate control – and that's exactly why Sherrod's self-funding opponents are writing themselves million-dollar checks to try to buy this seat. And it looks like their spending spree might be working – the latest polls show this race is in a dead heat.
But we can't pull ahead and win unless we reach our critical end-of-month goal, so we need to ask: Will you rush $5 or more to help Sherrod reach his end-of-month goal so he can win in Ohio and keep the Senate blue? Every dollar makes a difference to our grassroots campaign, and we're counting on you to come through.

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.

Hi — Five days from now, my team is going to close the books on our first
monthly fundraising goal of the 2024 election year.
It's an important moment because this goal will set the tone for the rest
of our campaign, and right now, we’re about 120 donations short of where we
need to be. I’d be deeply grateful if you chip in to help reach our goal.
*Here’s a personal link to chip in before our first deadline:

Since launching this campaign for the U.S. Senate, I've traveled across New
Jersey to meet parents, students, workers, faith leaders, and voters of
every background. I’ve heard their concerns, and I’m determined to run a
campaign that focuses on the solutions.
We’re fighting for streets safe from gun violence, good jobs for our
residents, communities prepared against climate change, and to keep
politicians out of women’s health care decisions.
We’re sharing a positive message about restoring honesty, integrity, and
selflessness to Washington DC.
And we’re running a campaign that brings everyone to the table to solve the
biggest problems of our day. I’ll leave no New Jerseyan behind in this
fight for a better state and nation.
*My campaign isn’t just about bringing new leadership to the Senate; it’s
about building the power to create change at every level.* That’s going to
take a strong grassroots team ready to do the hard work that change
requires, and that’s why I’m asking for your support today.

Friend –
Today during our morning coffee, my husband Larry and I ended up reminiscing a bit about our 30 years together. We actually met on a blind date! A friend of mine set us up, we met for margaritas, and he's been my biggest supporter ever since.
Larry was right by my side during my very first campaign for Congress in 2016 when I beat the odds and flipped a red district blue. And he was there when I became the only Democratic challenger to defeat a Republican senator in 2018 and just the second woman senator in Nevada's history. 
Do you know who else I've always been able to count on? This incredible grassroots team.
We've taken on some tough fights already, but there's no question that we're facing our toughest one yet: CNN ranks me as one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot – and experts at FiveThirtyEight say that Nevada could once again decide Senate control.
With the GOP coming after me as a top target for defeat, the only way I can fight back and win is with your critical grassroots support: Please, friend, will you chip in $5 or more now to keep Nevada and the Senate blue? Every dollar makes a huge, huge difference.

Thank you so much for always having my back. I'm grateful.

Friend –
									Today during our morning coffee, my husband Larry and I ended up reminiscing a bit about our 30 years together. We actually met on a blind date! A friend of mine set us up, we met for margaritas, and he's been my biggest supporter ever since.
Larry was right by my side during my very first campaign for Congress in 2016 when I beat the odds and flipped a red district blue. And he was there when I became the only Democratic challenger to defeat a Republican Senator in 2018 and just the second woman senator in Nevada's history. 
Do you know who else I've always been able to count on? This incredible grassroots team.
We've taken on some tough fights already, but there's no question that we're facing our toughest one yet: CNN ranks me as one of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot – and experts at FiveThirtyEight say that Nevada could once again decide Senate control.
With the GOP coming after me as a top target for defeat, the only way I can fight back and win is with your critical grassroots support: Please, friend, will you chip in $5 or more now to keep Nevada and the Senate blue? Every dollar makes a huge, huge difference.
Thank you so much for always having my back. I'm grateful.
									Jacky Rosen
A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

   Jenga — from
   overturning Roe to banning abortion drugs, Josh Hawley turned his mission
   to criminalize abortion nationwide into a family business — and he’s
   abused his power to do it. Please let me explain:

   said, two years ago, I would vote to confirm ONLY Supreme Court Justices
   who acknowledged Roe was wrong, this is why. Amy Barrett was the first
   openly pro-life nominee of my lifetime. And she was the deciding vote.

   IN 2017: Matt Kacsmaryk was nominated to be a federal judge for the north
   Texas district court.
   His confirmation stalled for years. We learned he even lied to hide just
   how bizarre his obsession with controlling people’s bodies really is:

   should not have taken name off anti-abortion article. Excerpt: 'The
   process only works if we... have candor and truthful answers. So that's
   significant,' said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee
   responsible for vetting Kacsmaryk's nomination.
   IN 2018: While his nomination languished in the Senate, Kacsmaryk made an
   investment in his future.
   So he became a campaign donor to Josh Hawley, a fellow member of the
   Federalist Society — a group of corporate activist lawyers with funders
   including Chevron, Google, and the Kochs.
   IN 2019: Now a U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley decided to make Kacsmaryk, his
   campaign donor, a federal judge.
   Hawley confirmed Kacsmaryk to the northern Texas district court — despite
   bipartisan opposition over Kacsmaryk’s Big Brother views on contraceptives
   and personal freedoms.
   IN 2022: A lawsuit was filed in the northern Texas district court by
   activist lawyers seeking to ban an abortion pill that millions have used
   safely. Abortion medication accounts for over half of all abortions.
   Josh Hawley’s wife led the suit. His donor was the judge.

On
   the right, a Vanity Fair headline that reads: Erin Morrow Hawley is
   leading the charge to ban abortion medication. She's also Josh Hawley's
   wife.
   APRIL 2023: Hawley’s donor judge ruled in favor of the suit led by
   Hawley’s wife, calling for a near-immediate ban on the abortion pill
   mifepristone in all 50 states.
   This was the first time a judge has ever unilaterally tried to take a drug
   off the market against FDA objections.
   Then, in his official capacity as U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley submitted an
   amicus brief demanding that the Supreme Court end a temporary injunction
   blocking the ruling (in his wife's lawsuit) by a judge (his campaign
   donor) to ban America's most commonly-used abortion medication.
   AND NOW: We’ve learned that the mifepristone case, led by Hawley’s wife,
   will be argued in front of the Supreme Court on March 26.

   one of the highest-stakes and closest-watched cases of the term —
   announcing it will hear oral arguments on how patients can access
   mifepristone, the commonly used abortion pill, on March 26.
   But this is hardly the first time that the Hawley family business has made
   it all the way to the Supreme Court:

   Senators shouldn’t be in the business of using their position to benefit
   their family’s legal careers and activism — especially if there’s a
   financial incentive to do so. And there shouldn’t even be a hint of
   campaign donations impacting who, when, and how a judge gets on a court.
   When I’m in the U.S. Senate, I’ll vote to restore Roe v. Wade. But I’ll
   also fight to end corruption like this by:
    1. Barring Senators from voting on judicial nominees who’ve given to
       their campaigns.
    2. Barring Senators from lobbying any court to benefit an immediate
       relative.
   Everyday Missourians deserve a Senator who will stand up and fight for
   their personal freedoms — not another corrupt politician obsessed with
   controlling our bodies, families, and lives — and I’m ready to serve.

Jenga — from overturning Roe to banning abortion drugs, Josh Hawley turned his mission to criminalize abortion nationwide into a family business — and he’s abused his power to do it. Please let me explain:
DEFEAT JOSH HAWLEY
IN 2017: Matt Kacsmaryk was nominated to be a federal judge for the north Texas district court.
His confirmation stalled for years. We learned he even lied to hide just how bizarre his obsession with controlling people’s bodies really is:
IN 2018: While his nomination languished in the Senate, Kacsmaryk made an investment in his future.
So he became a campaign donor to Josh Hawley, a fellow member of the Federalist Society — a group of corporate activist lawyers with funders including Chevron, Google, and the Kochs.
IN 2019: Now a U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley decided to make Kacsmaryk, his campaign donor, a federal judge.
Hawley confirmed Kacsmaryk to the northern Texas district court — despite bipartisan opposition over Kacsmaryk’s Big Brother views on contraceptives and personal freedoms.
IN 2022: A lawsuit was filed in the northern Texas district court by activist lawyers seeking to ban an abortion pill that millions have used safely. Abortion medication accounts for over half of all abortions.
Josh Hawley’s wife led the suit. His donor was the judge.
APRIL 2023: Hawley’s donor judge ruled in favor of the suit led by Hawley’s wife, calling for a near-immediate ban on the abortion pill mifepristone in all 50 states.
This was the first time a judge has ever unilaterally tried to take a drug off the market against FDA objections.
Then, in his official capacity as U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley submitted an amicus brief demanding that the Supreme Court end a temporary injunction blocking the ruling (in his wife's lawsuit) by a judge (his campaign donor) to ban America's most commonly-used abortion medication.
AND NOW: We’ve learned that the mifepristone case, led by Hawley’s wife, will be argued in front of the Supreme Court on March 26. 
But this is hardly the first time that the Hawley family business has made it all the way to the Supreme Court:
This is what corruption looks like — and this year, we’re going to make Hawley own it. So if you’re ready to end these Big Brother attacks on abortion and send a real warrior for working people to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate, please rush a donation of $10 or whatever you can afford to my grassroots campaign right now.
If you've stored your info with ActBlue Express, we'll process your contribution instantly:
Contribute $10
Contribute $25
Contribute $30
Contribute $50
Contribute $100
Contribute $250
Give another amount
Senators shouldn’t be in the business of using their position to benefit their family’s legal careers and activism — especially if there’s a financial incentive to do so. And there shouldn’t even be a hint of campaign donations impacting who, when, and how a judge gets on a court.
When I’m in the U.S. Senate, I’ll vote to restore Roe v. Wade. But I’ll also fight to end corruption like this by:
Barring Senators from voting on judicial nominees who’ve given to their campaigns.
Barring Senators from lobbying any court to benefit an immediate relative.
Everyday Missourians deserve a Senator who will stand up and fight for their personal freedoms — not another corrupt politician obsessed with controlling our bodies, families, and lives — and I’m ready to serve.
If you’re with me, please rush a donation of $10 or whatever you can afford to our grassroots campaign to defeat Josh Hawley today. Real people like you are the only folks I ever want to be accountable to in the U.S. Senate, so your support means the world to me.

=========================================I'll give you the good news first, Jenga: With the latest polls showing me neck and neck with my GOP opponents, we've just launched a brand-new TV ad to spread our pro-worker message to Ohio voters and pull ahead! 
Here's the bad news: My Trump-backed opponent is fighting back with TV ads of his own – and if we don't raise $100,000 by midnight tonight, we may not have the resources we need to keep up.
This is where you come in: With Senate control on the line, the GOP will be pulling out all the stops to defeat me. Unlike my self-funding opponents, I don't have a personal fortune to pour into this race. I'm running a true grassroots campaign, which means I'm counting on folks like you to power our reelection campaign to victory.
That's why I'm asking directly: Will you please chip in $5 or more now – as much as you can spare by midnight – so we can keep our new ad live, fight back against GOP attacks, and keep this Senate seat blue?

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work. 
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.
									Thank you!

=========================================   Friend, I want to make sure you know how important you are to this campaign. 
Because when I think about my top supporters, it’s not about how much they’ve chipped in. 
I think about the people who were there when I really needed them. Close to 150,000 people have donated to my campaign so far. 
And now that we’re in the election year, I need your help more than ever. 
I’ve got to be honest with you: We need January to be our biggest month of the campaign. 
He’s targeting Arizona, he’s targeting our race, because he knows Arizona is CRITICAL to his own re-election. 
So I’m asking you to send him a message. Make a donation today and you’ll go down as one of our Founding Donors in 2024 — one of the people doing everything they can to defeat Trump and Kari Lake. 
I really need you to join that group. Can you please make a $5 contribution to my campaign? We’ve got to hit our goals if we’re going to defend this seat from Kari Lake and Donald Trump. 
Contribute: https://act.gallegoforarizona.com/go/2374?t=1001&akid=1886%2E6821758%2EYj9UCz
Thank you in advance for making that donation. 
It means a lot.

Friend, I want to make sure you know how important you are to this campaign. 
Because when I think about my top supporters, it’s not about how much they’ve chipped in. 
I think about the people who were there when I really needed them. Close to 150,000 people have donated to my campaign so far. 
And now that we’re in the election year, I need your help more than ever.  
I’ve got to be honest with you: We need January to be our biggest month of the campaign. Kari Lake is spreading lies and chaos, and Trump is backing her completely.
Trump is targeting Arizona, he’s targeting our race, because he knows Arizona is CRITICAL to his own re-election. 
So I’m asking you to send him a message. Make a donation today and you’ll go down as one of our Founding Donors in 2024 — one of the people doing everything they can to defeat Trump and Kari Lake. 
I really need you to join that group. Can you please make a $5 contribution to my campaign? We’ve got to hit our goals if we’re going to defend this seat from Kari Lake and Donald Trump. 
If you've stored your info with ActBlue, we'll process your contribution instantly.

Thank you in advance for making that donation.

   As a single mom with three kids and a budget, I cook from scratch a lot.
   But when I’m in Washington, I cannot cook dinner, and in my first year in
   Congress there was a lot of complaining—even about pizza! My kids want
   their mom’s cooking, and they want it nearly every night, regardless of
   where the demands of my job require me to be.
   The solution is aggressive meal planning. On the days I fly to D.C. for
   votes and hearings, I get up at 5:30 a.m. I quickly get ready for the
   plane and then prepare a dinner for the kids to enjoy that night. It’s
   always a slow cooker recipe or something that can sit in the fridge until
   the kids cook it. 
   I’ve perfected a few quick, easy meal-prep recipes and I’d love to share
   them with you. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240130-1?refcode=em20240130-37123&amounts=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&refcode2=37123_10298894_WWZrxI&akid=37123%2E10298894%2EWWZrxI ]Donate any amount using this link and we’ll send you

=========================================Friend, I need your help.
My campaign is gearing up for our GOTV push in the coming weeks! With recent polls showing this race is starting to tighten, these on the ground organizing will be absolutely crucial to helping us reach supporters and the large number of voters who are still undecided in this race.
But now for the bad news:
Other candidates in this race have already launched MILLION dollar TV ad campaigns. That means they'll have a big advantage in convincing California voters to vote for them instead of me and can drown out my progressive message. Your support is absolutely vital right now to help us avoid falling behind in this critical race.
Friend, your donation today could be a game changer for my campaign. But unless I raise $50,000 toward my grassroots fundraising goal, we may have to cut back on how aggressively we're organizing on the ground. That's why I'm humbly asking: 
Will you please rush whatever you can spare to my campaign right now to help me make sure I have the resources to get out the vote and win over undecided voters? I'm counting on you to reach my fundraising goal before midnight tonight. >>

=========================================Jenga, it's Chuck Schumer. I'm reaching out to ask you to help my friend Kirsten Gillibrand. Will you give me a moment to explain?
I'm incredibly proud to call Kirsten my friend, colleague, and fellow New York senator. From her very first day serving in Congress back in 2007, she's been one of Washington's strongest voices for progress. Now, as senator, she's on the frontlines of the fights that matter most to families.
But as the 2024 election heats up, GOP megadonors are targeting Kirsten's seat for defeat. And right now, she's falling short of her critical $50,000 end-of-month goal. So I have to ask: Will you donate $5 or more before midnight to help Kirsten make up the gap and protect her must-win Senate seat? Please, Jenga, we need Kirsten's voice in the Senate – especially with far-right extremists threatening the rights and progress that we've fought so hard to win.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk4754-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Trust me on this: Kirsten delivers results. Over the last couple of years, she's won legislation to reform our military's criminal justice system, protect survivors of sexual harassment and assault, expand benefits for veterans and 9/11 first responders, crack down on gun trafficking, and tackle corruption in Washington. Now, she's leading the charge to win guaranteed paid family leave, certify the Equal Rights Amendment, restore reproductive rights, protect seniors, and so much more.
I've had the privilege of working closely with Kirsten on these issues and so many others. I've seen her fight harder than just about anyone else to build coalitions across the aisle, block dangerous bills, and get her legislation across the finish line. And I'm not exaggerating here: While in the House, Kirsten gave birth to her second son mere hours after working a 13-hour day.
Kirsten is one of a kind. And families in New York and across the nation need her voice in Washington advocating for their rights, priorities, and futures.
But that's why the GOP is ready to do everything within their power to defeat her this fall. New York Republicans celebrated their best election cycle in decades in 2022. Their extremist candidates flipped enough seats in the midterms to win control of the House and came within single digits of winning the governorship. Now, they're directly targeting Kirsten's seat to retake Senate control.
I know that my friend has what it takes to defeat the GOP and their megadonors. But because she refuses to accept money from corporate PACs, she's counting on strong grassroots support to win this critical race. So please, before her end-of-month deadline, will you rush a donation to help Kirsten defend her seat and continue to fight for progress for families in the Senate?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Fellow Conservative,
I’m honored to have received Donald J. Trump’s endorsement twice – in 2020 and 2022 – and I proudly endorse his campaign for president in 2024.   
<https://secure.winred.com/jim-marchant-for-us-senate/pg_rs-e_ae-trump-endorsed-marchant-e9d_20240130_a_?utm_source=RevShare&utm_campaign=MarchantJ_AE-Trump-Endorsed-Marchant_20240130&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=AE-Trump-Endorsed-Marchant&utm_agency=PG&amount=50>
America is falling apart, and President Trump is the one man who can bring our country back together because he’s done it before…  
During his previous term, President Trump revitalized our economy, creating record-low unemployment rates and fostering job opportunities for all. His steadfast stance on immigration ensures our national security and upholds the rule of law.   
Now more than ever, we need a leader who prioritizes America’s interests. Donald Trump’s proven track record makes him the best choice for a prosperous future. And I’m running for U.S. Senate in the crucial swing state of Nevada to fight alongside President Trump to END the far-left insanity and make America Great Again! 
But Sadly – I’m the only Enthusiastically Pro-Trump Republican candidate running for United States Senate in Nevada this election cycle. My opponent is backed by Mitch McConnell and his RINO fundraising machine!  
Will you please make a generous donation to support my campaign to flip Nevada red and be part of the Nationwide movement to Save America?

=========================================Friend, I'm asking for just $5. 
I'll tell you why: Black women running for office only raise one-third as much as white women. With this race becoming one of the most expensive in the country, I have to fight for every single dollar to pull ahead in the polls. 
$5 doesn't seem like much. But if every person reading this pitches in $5, we can build a powerful grassroots movement that can go toe to toe with the millions my opponents have raised from out-of-state donors and special interest lobbyists.
That's why my team and I set a daily goal to raise $25,000 by midnight, and we're still falling short. So I'm personally asking: Can you chip in $5 to help me spread my message of a progressive future to voters everywhere? My opponents outraised me last quarter, and we can't afford to fall short again.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1032-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Friend, recent polling shows this race is still up for grabs, with over 20% still undecided. But with my opponents bringing in millions that they can use to drown out our grassroots message, I need to make sure I'm hitting my goal each day to stay competitive.
Here's the good news: I'm the true progressive in this race. If we can just reach enough California voters with my vision of progress and justice, I'm certain we can build a country that works for all of us.
But I can't do it without this movement powering my fight, $5 at a time. Please: Will you give $5 right now so I can hit my $25,000 daily fundraising goal to pull ahead and take the lead in this race? With just hours left, we're still falling short – and I'm counting on you to close the gap.

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Friend, I'm asking for $5. Here's why: 
In a few days, I have to meet my critical end-of-month deadline – and I have to show my opponents and all who are watching that I have a strong team of grassroots supporters behind my movement for change. 
But right now, we're pacing behind on fundraising. Friend, if we fall short now, we may have to cut back on how aggressively we're organizing on the ground – and I'm trying to do everything in my power to avoid that.
That's why I set an emergency 24-hour goal to raise $25,000 to get back on track, and I'm counting on you to help me get there. So I'm humbly asking: 
Will you rush a donation now to help me hit my goal for the month and send me to the Senate?

Friend, I'm asking for $5. Here's why: 
In a few days, I have to meet my critical end-of-month deadline – and I have to show my opponents and all who are watching that I have a strong team of grassroots supporters behind my movement for change. 
But right now, we're pacing behind on fundraising. Friend, if we fall short now, we may have to cut back on how aggressively we're organizing on the ground – and I'm trying to do everything in my power to avoid that.
That's why I set an emergency 24-hour goal to raise $25,000 to get back on track, and I'm counting on you to help me get there. So I'm humbly asking: 
Will you rush a donation now to help me hit my goal for the month and send me to the Senate?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $5
Donate $25
Donate $50

Thank you.

Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

   John. I’m coming to you to see if you’ll help out my friend Bob Casey.

Hi
   there, [ https://act.elizabethwarren.com/go/1879?t=1006&akid=1913%2E6465200%2EsVQ9sm ]I’m
   asking if you can please pitch in tonight to help hit our first monthly
   fundraising goal of 2024.
   It’s powerfully important that we reach every grassroots fundraising
   target in this critical election year in order to campaign for our plans
   for big, structural change.
   Any sign of weakness — any decline of support — could signal that momentum
   behind these plans is weakening. That could enable our opponents to strike
   back, or potentially encourage them to recruit a challenger against me to
   try to put a stop to our plans.
   As a reminder, the plans we’re fighting for would stop...
     * MAGA extremists from engaging in voter suppression, overturning
       election results, and taking away our rights
     * Quality child care from eating up an entire paycheck
     * Big bank CEOs from gambling with working people’s livelihoods
     * The filibuster from blocking bills that most Americans are calling
       for, like protecting abortion rights and enacting gun safety laws
   And they would start...
     * Making multi-millionaires and billionaires pay a small wealth tax on
       fortunes greater than $50 million so all of our kids can have a
       fighting chance at success
     * Restoring public trust in our nation’s highest court by getting
       Supreme Court justices to follow a basic code of ethics (and at least
       four more new justices will follow those rules once we expand the
       Court, too)
     * Bringing down the cost of housing by increasing supply
     * Rooting corruption out of Washington
   [ https://act.elizabethwarren.com/go/1879?amount=28&t=1007&akid=1913%2E6465200%2EsVQ9sm ]A contribution of
   $28 or any
   amount you can give right now will help ensure we can advocate and grow
   momentum for these plans from the halls of the Senate and all across the
   country. And you’ll send a message to the special interests and
   out-of-touch ideologues that we're fighting against that together, we are
   going to defeat them.

=========================================   Friend: 
At midnight tomorrow our first end-of-month deadline of the election year hits. We’ve got important goals to meet before that deadline. 
Hitting those goals month after month will decide whether this is a campaign that can go the distance and win. 
Or whether we fall short, and lose our Senate majority. 
A minute after midnight, it’s too late. 
So please, before that deadline hits, make a donation to Ruben Gallego’s campaign for U.S. Senate in Arizona. 
Contribute: https://act.gallegoforarizona.com/go/2374?t=1001&akid=1905%2E6821758%2Ed_F8rO
We need this to be the biggest month of the campaign so far. 
Thanks in advance for chipping in.

Jenga, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is taking on the toughest fights in Washington: pushing to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, passing paid family leave, banning the distribution of ghost guns and so much more.
But in New York, the GOP just had their best election cycle in DECADES. With Politico reporting that Dems are facing a tough Senate map in 2024, they're more confident than ever.
Now, they're coming for Kirsten's seat — and she's counting on you to stand with her team during this critical moment.
 If she loses, all her hard-fought progress for working families — and our Senate majority — goes out the window. The only way she'll continue taking on the toughest fights in Washington and WINNING is with grassroots supporters like you by her side.
So please, Jenga, will you renew your Team Gillibrand membership with just $5 right now to keep Kirsten's seat and the Senate majority blue?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Can I tell you the story of how I first got involved in politics, friend?
While serving as the president of Nevada's largest synagogue, I was recruited to run in a competitive House race to help flip a red seat blue. Looking back, it's incredibly fitting that this was my entry point to public service – because my Judaism helps guide much of my work in the Senate today.
In fact, my decision to say "yes" and run for public office in the first place was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam – which means to leave the world a better place than how we found it.
Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I'm proud to serve Nevada and our country. And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help.
Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking:
If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you – if you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we love – will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

But I need your help.
Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate just set a new GOP fundraising record to defeat me, and recent polling shows me in a dead heat in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking:
If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you – if you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we love – will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

Thank you so much,

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

=========================================Hi everyone,
As we step into Black History Month, I want to tell you the story of a soda fountain in the segregated South before 1964.
At that time, barely fifty years ago, Black customers weren’t even allowed to sit in the same seats as white customers. Thanks to heroes like Dr. King and Fannie Lou Hamer, change was slowly spreading across America. But change hadn’t yet come to many small southern towns.
Even the seats at the soda fountain were still segregated — until one worker decided he was tired of waiting for that to change. He thought that if his Black customers weren’t allowed to sit, then nobody should be, and he removed every single seat in that shop.
Until everyone could sit as equals, they’d all just have to stand.
The man who removed those seats was my Dad, and I think about what he did often. Dad believed we all have a role to play in making change for the benefit of all, and by removing those seats, he found a common-sense solution to address an injustice.
**Photo of Tammy Murphy and her father after Tammy's college graduation. Tammy is in a cap and gown holding a diploma, and her dad is beaming with pride.**
Fifty years later, we’ve come a long way from the days of segregation, but we have a long way to go still. Systemic racism lives on, and we all have a role to play in fighting back against it.
It’s why I made combating racial disparities in maternal and infant health the key issue of my time as First Lady, and it’s driving my campaign for the U.S. Senate today.
This month, let’s celebrate men and women like Dr. King, Fannie Lou Hamer, John Lewis, and so many more, who have helped us come so far. But let’s not stop there. Let’s ask ourselves what small things we can do to make our communities fairer and safer for everyone.
For my Dad, it was removing the seats at the segregated soda fountain.
What will it be for you?
Together,
Tammy Murphy

=========================================April 5, 2023.
That was the day I launched my reelection campaign, friend. In all honesty, I was a bit nervous. I was confident in this grassroots team, but I knew that one of the biggest challenges would be raising the kind of money we need to win.
10%
That's the percentage of people who open emails like this – and you're one of them. I hope I can count on you to take the next step by chipping in today. Because every donation – no matter the amount – makes a difference.
$100,000.
That's what we need to raise before tomorrow's end-of-month deadline to hold onto Nevada's battleground seat.
CNN is calling me one of the most vulnerable senators in the country, and polling shows me neck and neck with my GOP opponent. We're one misstep away from losing Nevada to Mitch McConnell and his allies – and Senate control along with it. That's why we can't risk missing crucial goals like this one.
If just 57 more people from 02120 chip in before midnight, we'll be on track to reach tonight's goal. So please, can you make a $5 donation to keep both Nevada and the Senate blue?

April 5, 2023.
									That was the day I launched my reelection campaign, friend. In all honesty, I was a bit nervous. I was confident in this grassroots team, but I knew that one of the biggest challenges would be raising the kind of money we need to win.
10%.
									That's the percentage of people who open emails like this – and you're one of them. I hope I can count on you to take the next step by chipping in today. Because every donation – no matter the amount – makes a difference.
$100,000.
									That's what we need to raise before tomorrow's end-of-month deadline to hold onto Nevada's battleground seat.
CNN is calling me one of the most vulnerable senators in the country, and polling shows me neck and neck with my GOP opponen. We're one misstep away from losing Nevada to Mitch McConnell and his allies – and Senate control along with it. That's why we can't risk missing crucial goals like this one.
If just 57 more people from 02120 chip in before midnight, we'll be on track to reach tonight's goal. So please, can you make a $5 donation to keep both Nevada and the Senate blue?
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $5
Donate $25
Donate $50
Donate another amount
Thank you. I'm so grateful to have your support.

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
									Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

   In 2022, amidst rising inflation, I’m sure you’ll remember there was a lot
   of finger pointing. Was it supply chains, interrupted by war and the
   pandemic? Greedy corporations? Washington’s failure to act?
   All three played a role. And I was deeply disappointed that the Senate
   never even bothered to vote on my bill that would have made price-gouging
   by oil companies illegal. But in fall of 2022, armed with lots of data, I
   used a Congressional Hearing to get answers from an economist who
   confirmed what I saw the numbers pointing to: record, rising corporate
   profits were accounting for at least half of the higher prices consumers
   were paying.

   Big corporations still are trying to play the victim here—saying they’re
   just passing on higher costs to customers. But oftentimes, that’s BS. From
   July through September 2023, the most recent period we have data for,
   corporate profits were just shy of the record peak they reached in 2022.
   Collectively, big corporations are making more than a *trillion* dollars
   more every three months than they were in 2017.
   It’s on Congress to rein in these corporations. Too many billionaires are
   getting richer while more and more families can’t afford rent. And that’s
   exactly why I’m running for the U.S. Senate.
   I’m the only Democrat in this race who has never taken a dime from
   corporate PACs, but now I’m being outspent by my opponent who has taken
   these checks for decades. I need your support if we’re going to compete.

=========================================There's no question about it, friend:
Jacky Rosen (D-NV) is the most vulnerable Democratic woman in the Senate this November.
In 2022, Senate control came down to Nevada. The GOP thinks this will be the year they can finally win in Nevada, so Republicans are already spending MILLIONS to flip Jacky's seat and deliver the Senate directly to Mitch McConnell. 
If Republicans win in November, there's a real danger that our shared future, from voting rights to reproductive freedom, will be in serious jeopardy.
But with time running out before our first end-of-month deadline of the year, we're on track to miss our big $100,000 goal. Election Day will be here before you know it, so it's critically important that we show the strength of our grassroots movement early – so please, friend:
Will you rush $5 or more right now to win in Nevada and defend the Senate for Democrats? Every dollar makes a difference.

=========================================                           [ https://act.katieporter.com/go/14559?t=1001&akid=37063%2E10298894%2EBnMBLh ]Katie Porter for Senate
   Here’s a naked and sometimes uncomfortable truth about every single
   candidate emailing you for $5 to help them get elected: they want power.
   I’m not excluded from that statement. But what we should ask every single
   candidate, every day, is what they will do with that power.
   Prior to Trump being elected, I never considered running for office. I
   didn’t work my way up to Congress or serve in student government. I was a
   law professor and consumer protection advocate who studied and saw how big
   corporations were cheating the rest of us. When I first ran for office in
   2018, I was (and still am!) a single mom of three school age kids who
   drives a minivan.
   Now, I’m running for the U.S. Senate because I want the power to go after
   the corrupt special interests that are making it difficult for families to
   get ahead. Oil companies need to be held accountable for their messes.
   Health insurance and pharmaceutical companies need to be held accountable
   for breaking laws, and for lobbying for a healthcare system that exists to
   serve their bottom lines. And corporations and the ultra-wealthy need to
   be held accountable when they cheat on their taxes.
   Our current system is not good enough, and it’s not going to be “good
   enough” to just go back to the way things were before Donald Trump. I’ve
   never taken a dime from corporate PACs and I don’t take money from federal
   lobbyists—you can always count on me to fight for working people and shake
   up the status quo.
   My mentor and former law professor Elizabeth Warren taught me that nobody
   gets elected alone. It’s true! I can’t do this without you. [ https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kp4s-em-20240128-1?refcode=em20240128-37063&refcode2=37063_10298894_BnMBLh&akid=37063%2E10298894%2EBnMBLh ]Right now,
   we’re being outspent on TV ads by millions of dollars. With just five
   weeks until Election day, we urgently need to catch up. Can you chip in
   today?

=========================================Jenga, this is bad news for Democrats: Trump just won the GOP Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary last month, and now he's TIED in the polls with President Biden.
We cannot let Trump win back control of the White House. Please, will you add your name before 11:59 p.m. tonight to stand with President Biden and stop Trump from retaking power?
SIGN ON NOW: STAND WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN
https://surveys.signforgood.com/KEG-Jan-2024-Stand-w-Biden-Email?email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120&ask=10&amounts=10,25,50,100&code=jtk4780-su-text&refcode=jtk4780-su-text
Jenga, Trump is a direct threat to our democracy. But still, he's almost guaranteed to be the GOP Presidential candidate in 2024, and Biden's approval ratings have us seriously concerned for this November.
Jenga, President Biden has fought tirelessly to protect our democracy and rebuild the strength of our elections. And recently, he boldly condemned the insurrection and Trump's role in inciting this horrific attack on our democracy.
But with polls showing a tied race, President Biden needs strong Democrats like you on his team! Please, will you add your name to our new petition before midnight tonight to stand with President Biden? We're counting on 10,000 Democrats to sign on, so please act now!

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

=========================================Friend – we're only one day away from our crucial first end-of-month deadline of the year – and we need to show the GOP that our campaign is beginning the election year strong.
That's why this couldn't be happening at a worse possible moment: I just checked ActBlue, and our online fundraising is slowing down – putting us on track to fall short of our $100,000 goal.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_january_2024?refcode=jtk3382-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
If that wasn't bad enough, a shady MAGA billionaire poured $2 MILLION into Nevada – all to help Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate defeat me! Polling already shows me in a dead heat, and experts predict this race could decide Senate control.
We need to turn things around ASAP, but we can't do that without the immediate grassroots support of people like you. So please, will you rush $5 or more right now – as much as you can spare by midnight – to help us reach our critical end-of-month fundraising goal, win in Nevada, and keep the Senate blue?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.

Can I tell you the story of how I first got involved in politics, friend? 
While serving as the president of Nevada's largest synagogue, I was recruited to run in a competitive House race to help flip a red seat blue. Looking back, it's incredibly fitting that this was my entry point to public service – because my Judaism is at the very core of my work in the Senate today.
In fact, my decision to say "yes" and run for public office in the first place was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam – which means to leave the world a better place than how we found it.
Now, as the third Jewish woman and only former synagogue president in Senate history, I'm proud to serve Nevada and our country. And as we face everything from growing antisemitism to attacks on reproductive freedom to threats to tear down our very democracy, I'm as committed as ever to keep fighting to better this world and make positive change happen. But I need your help.
Mitch McConnell's handpicked candidate has launched his campaign to defeat me, and recent polling shows me neck and neck with my GOP opponent in the race that experts say will likely decide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking:
If the principle of Tikkun Olam resonates with you – if you're with me in the fight to continue making progress for the people and communities that we love – will you chip in $5 or more today to help me defend my seat in Nevada and our Democratic Senate majority?

A note from Sen. Jacky Rosen:
Friend, I’m fighting tirelessly in the Senate to deliver progress for people across Nevada and our country. But experts say I’m one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection, and the GOP is zeroing in on me as a top target for defeat.
									That’s why I’m counting on your critical grassroots support to fight back and win. Senate control will all come down to Nevada – and I need to know you’re with me.
									Will you chip in now to win in Nevada and defend our Democratic Senate majority? You can also text JACKY to 30508 to become a core member of our team and receive exclusive updates from my campaign.
									Thank you,
Jacky

=========================================Jenga, big change starts small.
That's a lesson that my grandmother, Polly Noonan, first taught me decades ago. Well before most women had any political power, my grandmother organized women into a political force in Albany.
By the time I was in elementary school, I was tagging along with her to all kinds of Democratic campaign headquarters, rallies and events. She remains one of my biggest role models — and I carry her wisdom with me to this day. She taught me that my voice matters, that women’s voices matter and that grassroots activism matters. And she showed me how campaigns are won by the people who put in the work like the volunteers knocking doors, stuffing envelopes, turning out the vote and donating what they can, when they can.
For decades, first by my grandmother's side and then as a public servant myself, I've seen how those small grassroots actions all add up to victory on Election Day. That's how Democrats defeated the odds in 2022 to defend and even expand our Senate majority. And that's why I know that we can win again in 2024.
With Democrats defending 23 seats, the odds are certainly stacked against us. And after the 2022 red wave in New York, Republicans here are already targeting my seat for defeat. But when people like you get off the sidelines and chip in even just $3, eventually we'll build a grassroots movement capable of defeating even the GOP's wealthiest megadonors.
So please, will you chip in $3 or $25 or whatever you can spare today to help save our Senate majority by building a grassroots movement one grassroots gift at a time? I refuse to accept money from corporate PACs, so these grassroots donations are truly critical to my campaign.

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Friend, we're making incredible strides to defeat Ted Cruz, and now, I am personally asking for your support to keep up this incredible momentum by helping me raise $500,000 before our end-of-month fundraising deadline.
DONATE $5 NOW →
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw-allred-email-jan-2024?refcode=jtk1073-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250&amount=5
Since we launched this campaign, the Cook Political Report and Roll Call both upgraded our chances of winning. FiveThirtyEight now says Texas could be Democrats' best chance to flip a red seat blue. And a recent poll shows us statistically tied with Ted Cruz, with 11% of voters undecided.
This is a testament to the powerful grassroots movement we're building, friend, and I'm so thrilled that you're a part of it. But the more national attention this race gets, the more extremists will be lining up to fill Ted Cruz's war chest. I'm counting on your immediate support to help me keep up our momentum from now until Election Day.
Will you donate $5, $25, or any amount that's meaningful to you to help defeat Ted Cruz ahead of our end-of-month deadline? We're still $133,256 short to hit our $500k goal →

						Democrat Colin Allred is running against Ted Cruz to deliver real leadership to Texans. But this fight is going to take a historic grassroots movement to win.
Inside Elections upgraded our race from “Solid Republican” to “Battleground” the day Colin announced his campaign, and experts at CBS are predicting this could be the most expensive Senate race in 2024!
												That’s why we need all hands on deck every step of the way to win in Texas, defeat Ted Cruz and defend the Senate majority →
DONATE →

   climate change, gun safety and so much more — could come down to this

Jenga, by now you’ve heard just about every reason why your support matters so much to my campaign.
But with just hours to go until my final end-of-month fundraising deadline before early voting begins in this Senate race, is there anything else I can say to convince you to chip in before midnight?
Like the fact a late-breaking surge by celebrity Republican candidate Steve Garvey is completely upending this race?
Or the fact that I don’t take corporate PAC money to fund our campaign?
Or that so many of the things we care about — reproductive freedom, climate change, gun safety and so much more — could come down to this election?
I believe I’ve said it all, but with our donations lagging at the worst possible time, I have to ask again — is there anything I can say to convince you to donate?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
EXPRESS DONATE $10

This grassroots team has stood by me on so many occasions.
But as we face our greatest challenge yet on this campaign, I need you. One. More. Time.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

=========================================Jenga , 
I want to start out by personally thanking you for being a member of our 
grassroots team. I know Hung is SO appreciative of all you’ve done for our 
mission so far, and I am too.
We have achieved so much already and the year has just begun. We’ve already 
raised more than $100,000 in just one month!
Plus, our average donation was $25 - proof that we really are fueled by 
grassroots patriots who are sick and tired of career politicians like Tim Kaine.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this race is going to be won at the 
grassroots level.
It’s truly us vs. Tim Kaine and the swamp, and with conservatives as strong as 
you are on our team, I know we can win.
We’re just getting started, and we’re ready to WIN on Election Day. Will you 
help us keep up our incredible momentum and pitch in now?

=========================================Hi friend,
I’m Sheldon Whitehouse, U.S. Senator for Rhode Island.
I'm working every day to defend Medicare and Social Security, make high-quality health care more affordable, and ensure the courts work for the people. My Democratic colleagues and I are advancing President Biden’s agenda, and we’re determined to pass more legislation that will grow and strengthen the middle class.
I also don’t shy away from a fight, particularly if it involves the big special interests trying to bend the government to do their bidding. This gets me some grief from right-wing circles, which is clearly a sign that they're feeling the heat.
For years, I’ve led the effort to expose the role of special interests and dark money in capturing our courts and killing legislation to address climate change, and I will continue to do so as long as anonymous billionaire donors are able to buy unlimited political influence.
For a long time, I was one of the only people taking on this dark money apparatus, but other progressive voices have now joined in. I'm optimistic that we’re building the momentum to turn the tide, but our work is far from over.
I hope you will stay in touch as we continue the fight. You can find me on social media here: 
Twitter - https://twitter.com/senwhitehouse
Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/SheldonWhitehouse
Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/sheldonforri
Thanks so much for your support. I’m hopeful about the future because of the incredible team we're building.
Sincerely,
Sheldon Whitehouse

=========================================Friend: Barbara Lee is exactly the kind of leader we need in the Senate taking on Mitch McConnell and GOP extremism. That's why some of the most influential people in progressive politics have reached out and asked you to please chip in and power this historic campaign. 
But it looks like you still have not answered their call for help. Experts are calling this one of the most competitive Senate races in history, and with just hours left, Barbara Lee is still short of her $25,000 daily fundraising goal. If this team is going to help her compete with the millions her opponents have hauled in, we can't slow down our efforts now.
So we're following up one last time: Please, will you donate whatever you can so that Rep. Lee can reach her midnight fundraising goal and defend our razor-thin Senate Democratic majority?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1023-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Friend, Rep. Lee was incredibly honored to have received endorsements from giants in the progressive space, such as Rep. Ro Khanna, Stacey Abrams, Rep. Ayanna Pressley and more. Because endorsements like theirs will go a long way in swaying California's undecided voters. 
But here’s the reality: We can’t afford to take our foot off the gas – not when recent polls show this race is starting to tighten. The only thing standing between Barbara Lee pulling ahead in this race is reaching more voters with her progressive message – and that takes resources.
So please, will you chip in $5 before midn‌ight to help her reach this crucial $25,000 fundraising goal and take her fight for progress to the Senate?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lee-sen-email?refcode=jtk1023-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Thank you for your unyielding support,
Team Lee

Friend: Barbara Lee is exactly the kind of leader we need in the Senate taking on Mitch McConnell and GOP extremism. That's why some of the most influential people in progressive politics have reached out and asked you to please chip in and power this historic campaign.
But it looks like you still have not answered their call for help. Experts are calling this one of the most competitive Senate races in history, and with just hours left, Barbara Lee is still short of her $25,000 daily fundraising goal. If this team is going to help her compete with the millions her opponents have hauled in, we can't slow down our efforts now.
So we're following up one last time: Please, will you donate whatever you can so that Rep. Lee can reach her midn‌ight fundraising goal and defend our razor-thin Senate Democratic majority?
DONATE NOW >>>
Friend, Rep. Lee was incredibly honored to have received endorsements from giants in the progressive space, such as Rep. Ro Khanna, Stacey Abrams, Rep. Ayanna Pressley and more. Because endorsements like theirs will go a long way in swaying California's undecided voters.
But here’s the reality: We can’t afford to take our foot off the gas – not when recent polls show this race is starting to tighten. The only thing standing between Barbara Lee pulling ahead in this race is reaching more voters with her progressive message – and that takes resources.
So please, will you chip in $5 before midn‌ight to help her reach this crucial $25,000 fundraising goal and take her fight for progress to the Senate? 
If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Thank you for your unyielding support,
									Team Lee
Thank you for supporting Barbara Lee as she fights to be the next Democratic Senator from California! Our team is working around the clock to ensure Barbara moves to the General Election in what experts are calling the most expensive Senate race ever.
Barbara Lee is a proven progressive champion who has spent the last 25 years fighting for our progressive values in the House.
Now, she's ready to take this fight to the Senate. But Barbara is being outraised and outspent – and she needs your help to pull ahead in this race.
Donate Now →
We just need to raise enough to spread Barbara’s progressive message across the state. Because with recent polling showing that a large number of California voters are undecided on who to vote for, we must invest more into our voter outreach efforts than ever before.

=========================================Jenga, with the 2024 election cycle in full swing, I'm facing an uphill battle to win reelection in Ohio.
While my self-funding GOP opponents are focused on winning the approval of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, I'm working in the Senate to raise wages, protect abortion rights, and make sure every family has the chance to succeed. Because when you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work.
Experts at Politico say our race could decide Senate control – and right now, polls show that this race is in a dead heat. But while my opponents are writing themselves million-dollar checks to try to buy this seat, I'm running a true grassroots campaign that relies on folks like you. 
That's why my team and I just set an ambitious $250,000 end-of-month goal to fight back against the GOP's spending and win this race – and I'm counting on you to help us reach it. So please, will you chip in $5 right now to keep this seat and the Senate blue?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-24?refcode=jtk1209-fr-text&amounts=250,100,50,25,5
There's a reason why national Republicans are zeroing in on our race: They know that if they flip this seat red, they can retake Senate control. That's why they're spending MILLIONS to launch attack ads and defeat me.
I know what it's like to run a tough race – but each time before, we've won because we've always fought for what's right, Jenga. And with the future of our country on the line – from abortion rights to our very democracy – I'm asking for your help to do it again.
So I'm personally asking: Will you give $5 or more right now to help us win reelection, keep this Senate seat blue, and defend our Democratic majority?

=========================================                         [1]Lucas Kunce for U.S. Senate
   Jenga — Lucas Kunce is running for
   U.S. Senate because he’s on a mission to take power back for working
   people in Missouri and across the country.
   Unlike Josh Hawley, Lucas isn’t taking cues from the corrupt mega-donors
   and corporate elites who’ve spent decades tearing our country up. He’s
   relying on input from real people like you to drive our campaign’s message
   and priorities from the very start — and that’s why we’re reaching out to
   you.
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/survey/lk-welcome-email-survey?t=1001&akid=4702%2E1040133%2EyKNNKo ]Will you take just a few moments to share your thoughts and priorities
   with Lucas in this quick survey?
                             SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS »
   Lucas doesn’t have a network of shady mega-donors or corporate elites
   backing up his campaign — and he wouldn’t have it any other way. We’re
   building a people-powered movement because everyday Americans are the only
   people Lucas wants to serve in the U.S. Senate.
   Part of that means Lucas won’t accept any corporate PAC money in this
   race. But it also means we need input from folks like you to guide our
   strategy and priorities throughout this campaign. So
   Jenga:
   [ https://act.lucaskunce.com/survey/lk-welcome-email-survey?t=1002&akid=4702%2E1040133%2EyKNNKo ]Can you take just a minute or two to share your priorities and thoughts
   with Lucas in this quick survey? Your feedback is invaluable as we build
   out this campaign to flip Missouri’s U.S. Senate seat.

   Tammy is one of Mitch McConnell’s TOP targets to defeat, which is why he

   Eric Hovde is Senate Republicans’ #1 choice to flip Wisconsin’s Senate
   seat. He’s a MAGA loyalist and an anti-abortion extremist who wants to cut
   Social Security and repeal the Affordable Care Act.
   He’s also willing to spend at least $20 million of his own personal
   fortune to defeat Tammy.
   It’s going to demand a CRAZY amount of resources to defend Tammy against
   the flood of future attacks — but I’m counting on you to step up because
   our Senate majority depends on it.

Friend: When I was growing up, I never could have imagined that I'd run for
elected office one day – let alone become the first computer programmer and
the first former synagogue president ever elected to the Senate.
As the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants and the daughter of a World War
II veteran, I was surrounded by loved ones who taught me the values of hard
work, determination, and persistence – and I've carried these with me my
entire life.

I carried those values with me when I was working as a cocktail waitress at
Caesars Palace to pay for college, becoming the first in my family to
graduate. I carried them with me when I was working as a computer
programmer in a male-dominated field.

I carried those values with me during my first-ever campaign for Congress
in 2016, when I flipped a highly competitive district from red to blue,*
and in 2018, when I defeated a Republican incumbent against all odds –
becoming the second woman senator in Nevada's history.*

race]

To this day, those values of hard work, determination, and persistence fuel
my fight to advocate for working families and bring much-needed progress to
the lives of all Nevadans.
*But right now, experts at The Washington Post are calling me one of the
most vulnerable senators up for reelection – and FiveThirtyEight says that
Nevada could once again decide Senate control.*
The GOP will come after me with everything they've got, and I simply cannot
fight back without your grassroots support. *So please, friend, will you
contribute $5 or more today to help me defend my seat and protect our
Democratic Senate majority?

Friend: When I was growing up, I never could have imagined that I'd run for elected office one day – let alone become the first computer programmer and the first former synagogue president ever elected to the Senate.
As the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants and the daughter of a World War II veteran, I was surrounded by loved ones who taught me the values of hard work, determination, and persistence – and I've carried these with me my entire life.
I carried those values with me when I was working as a cocktail waitress at Caesars Palace to pay for college, becoming the first in my family to graduate. I carried them with me when I was working as a computer programmer in a male-dominated field.
I carried those values with me during my first-ever campaign for Congress in 2016, when I flipped a highly competitive district from red to blue, and in 2018, when I defeated a Republican incumbent against all odds – becoming the second woman senator in Nevada's history.
To this day, those values of hard work, determination, and persistence fuel my fight to advocate for working families and bring much-needed progress to the lives of all Nevadans.
But right now, experts at The Washington Post are calling me one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection – and FiveThirtyEight says that Nevada could once again decide Senate control.
The GOP will come after me with everything they've got, and I simply cannot fight back without your grassroots support. So please, friend, will you contribute $5 or more today to help me defend my seat and protect our Democratic Senate majority?

Folks, it’s Jim Clyburn here. Can you take two minutes to read my note about Lisa Blunt Rochester?
She's running for Senate in Delaware and I know she'd be perfect for the job. And there's no better time than Black History Month to tell you that she'd be the first Black and female Senator to represent her state.
Before I tell you more about what makes Lisa Blunt Rochester the perfect fit for Senator, can I ask that you make a split contribution of $15 or more to help elect her in November and keep Delaware blue? [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_clyburn_split?refcode=LOC_EM_FR_2024.02.01_B1_Clyburn_Split-30op&amount=15]

Having worked with Lisa side-by-side in the House and as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I know she'll be a strong voice for affordable housing, protecting the Affordable Care Act and Social Security entitlements, and ensuring our voting rights are secure.
And representation matters, there is no denying it.
That's why in addition to Lisa's track record of fighting for the issues that matter to Delawareans, it means so much that she'd be a role model for little Black girls across our country.
But Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and their group of MAGA allies want nothing more than to flip this seat red and retake the Senate. It's why they'll do anything in their power to support Lisa's opponents.
Will you join me in the fight to elect Lisa Blunt Rochester and build representation in the Senate? Please split a contribution of any amount between her campaign and mine.
This won't come cheap for our campaign, so we're asking for your support. Will you chip in as much as you can swing to help elect Lisa Blunt Rochester so she can fight back against the MAGA agenda and protect our democracy?

=========================================   Friend —
We’re not going to give too much more oxygen to the chaos in Arizona between Kari Lake and the state party. 
It’s messy, it’s confusing, it’s embarrassing. 
But for all the chaos right now, make no mistake:
Kari Lake is tightening her grip on the GOP. It will be Kari Lake and Donald Trump leading the fight to take back Arizona. And they'll have no shortage of fanatics and extremists — including the rich and powerful — backing them up. 
We’re gearing up for the fight of our lifetimes here, because Arizona is the most important state in the country. Arizona will determine control of the Senate and the White House. 
We have to do everything we can to win. We can’t waste any time. 
So please, if you can, make a contribution to Ruben Gallego’s campaign for U.S. Senate in Arizona. We’re trailing in the polls, and we’re behind on our goals. We need to take back the lead.

   Eric Hovde is Senate Republicans’ #1 choice to flip Wisconsin’s Senate
   seat. He’s a MAGA loyalist and an anti-abortion extremist who wants to cut
   Social Security and repeal the Affordable Care Act.
   He’s also willing to spend at least $20 million of his own personal
   fortune to defeat Tammy.
   It’s going to demand a CRAZY amount of resources to defend Tammy against
   the flood of future attacks — but I’m counting on you to step up because
   our Senate majority depends on it.

As you
   read this, anti-abortion political groups are drafting a plan to rescind
   abortion rights in every way possible — and they’ll hand that plan to
   President Trump on Day 1 of his presidency.
   New POLITICO reporting has detailed how these groups advise leveraging new
   rules at agencies like the FTC, FDA, and EPA, as well as using executive
   orders to slash abortion access nationwide — without needing to receive
   Congressional approval.
   They’re calling it the Heritage Foundation’s 2025 Presidential Transition
   Project. It’s almost 1,000 pages long, and its authors include members of
   the first Trump administration, Students for Life, Susan B. Anthony
   Pro-Life America and other anti-abortion organizations. They’re also
   collecting resumes from conservative activists who are interested in
   becoming political appointees of these agencies to carry out these new
   anti-abortion measures themselves.
   This will enable the Trump administration to have everything and everyone
   it needs to carry out its goal of rescinding abortion rights everywhere
   nationwide — no matter where you live.
   As these
   groups work on their plan, I’ve got a plan too. To fight like hell to keep
   Trump out of the White House, work to re-elect President Biden, flip the
   House, and expand the Senate with more pro-choice Democrats. That way,
   we’ll have the votes we need to codify abortion rights into federal law.

   today is one of the best ways to make sure that the Heritage Foundation’s
   2025 Presidential Transition Project remains just a radical little pet
   project and never sees the light of day. Will you please pitch in
   $28 or

=========================================FIVETHIRTYEIGHT POLLING UPDATE:
Trump and Biden are neck and neck in the polls!
We need to rally behind President Biden before it's too late — but we still don't know where you stand!
Please respond before 11:59 p.m. to ensure your response is counted.
Jenga: From improving our nation’s infrastructure and helping create millions of new jobs to lowering health care costs and making college more affordable, President Biden has delivered real progress for the American people.
But Republicans have been working overtime to attack the president and undermine all of his accomplishments. Now, polls show him locked in a statistical TIE with Donald Trump in the race for the White House! 
This is dangerous, Jenga. Trump has already attacked our democracy, and he’s racked up a staggering 91 criminal charges since leaving office. He even said that he will be a dictator on "day one" if reelected.
If Democrats don’t stand united behind President Biden at this crucial moment, Donald Trump could win reelection and do irreparable harm to our country and democracy from within.
That’s why we're looking for 54 grassroots Democrats in your area to confirm their support and endorse President Biden before midnight — but we’re still missing your name. Please, tell us now:
Do you endorse President Biden?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Hey there Jenga , 
I can’t believe it - we only have ONE DAY until our first end-of-month 
deadline of the election year.
It’s almost time to close the books on our most important deadline yet, and I 
just got off the phone with my team.
Right now, we have to raise $15,000 by TOMORROW NIGHT at MIDNIGHT if we’re 
going to meet our end-of-month goal.
I promise you that every dollar we raise makes a HUGE impact, FirstName. We 
need this money to be able to make voter contacts with Virginians across our 
commonwealth and start to get our ads on the air and spread our message.
I know we can meet this goal, but we can’t do it without you. Can you pitch in 
right now so we can meet our FIRST end-of-month deadline of the election year 
before tomorrow at midnight?

=========================================I just launched my Campaign Priorities Survey in my race to DEFEAT Kevin Cramer and reclaim this Senate seat for Democrats. I’m working hard to build a campaign every grassroots Democrat can be proud of. That’s why I’m personally asking for your input. I’m counting on 1,000 supporters to share their thoughts so I know what’s most important to you and your family. Will you take my 10-second survey before midnight? >> [https://secure.ngpvan.com/JtmbMOxNQUGApl0lhIm5KQ2?source=20240201_em_pet_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs_v1]
I know I usually reach out to ask you for money.
But I just launched my Campaign Priorities Survey to unseat Kevin Cramer – and what I need more than anything right now is your personal input.
Will you take 10 seconds to complete my survey and share your priorities with me? I can’t tell you how much I’m relying on your feedback to win this race, oust extreme Republican Kevin Cramer, and win this seat. I need 1,000 responses before midnight to shape my path forward. Can I count on your response? >> [https://secure.ngpvan.com/JtmbMOxNQUGApl0lhIm5KQ2?source=20240201_em_pet_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs_v1]

I’ll be frank:
– Instead of working for everyday Americans, I watched Cramer support cuts to Social Security.
– Instead of defending our democracy, I watched him vote to block Congress’ investigation into the insurrection at our capitol.
– Instead of protecting reproductive rights, I watched him cheer the overturning of Roe v. Wade and support a federal abortion ban.
I’m tired of it – and I know you are too.
That’s why I just launched my Campaign Priorities Survey to learn about what issues matter most to hardworking Americans. It would mean the world to me if you could take 10 seconds to share your feedback with me and help me replace Kevin Cramer in the Senate. Will you take my survey before midnight? >> [https://secure.ngpvan.com/JtmbMOxNQUGApl0lhIm5KQ2?source=20240201_em_pet_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs_v1]
In Washington, I'll always make sure your voice is heard.
That starts now — because Americans deserve better than Kevin Cramer and Senate Republican's extreme agenda.
Folks like you deserve a seat at the table – especially when it comes to issues that affect your pocketbook. That’s why it’s so important that I hear your opinions in my Campaign Priorities Survey. I’m asking 1,000 supporters to share their priorities with me before midnight to help me build an unbeatable campaign. I can’t wait to see what issues matter most to you. >> [https://secure.ngpvan.com/JtmbMOxNQUGApl0lhIm5KQ2?source=20240201_em_pet_b1_katrina_30_cl_rs_v1]

=========================================   Hey there, my name is Harry Dunn. 
3 years ago as a Capitol Police officer, I defended the U.S. Capitol from insurrectionists. Today, I’m running to be the next Democrat to represent Maryland's 3rd District. 
I'm facing a critical end-of-month deadline on Wednesday, so I'm hoping you can chip in just $5 to me and PARTNER before then >>
https://act.gallegoforarizona.com/go/2375?t=1001&akid=1876%2E6821758%2Ezpq8Oq
On January 6th, I fought on the frontlines to stop Donald Trump and his MAGA mob from overturning a free and fair election. I witnessed my fellow officers be beaten bloody and attacked by people with hate in their heart.
I defended members of Congress who invited the violence into the Capitol. I returned to work, despite the trauma, and watched horrified as those same members refused to take action or even denounce the violence. 
That day showed me just how fragile and precious our democracy is. We need fighters in Congress who are willing to show up to hold far-right extremists accountable.
I’m running because I’m passionate about this and I’m not going to sit back and wait for someone else to do it. But Trump and his rabid supporters will stop at NOTHING to stop me from winning this open seat. 
I set a huge end-of-month goal of $100,000 and I need your help to crush it and show we've got the grassroots power behind this campaign to win! Can you chip in even just $5 to me and Ruben Gallego to join us in this fight?

Jenga,
I’m reaching out with a personal request: Will you make a donation of any amount to my reelection campaign before the end-of-month deadline?
My work in the Senate is powered by our grassroots team -- and your support has helped me deliver real results. I’m counting on you to stick with me because there’s still so much more we can do to make Americans’ lives better.
The first fundraising deadline of 2024 is tomorrow and my team tells me we’re making steady progress toward our goal. You can help us start the year strong by donating today.
Your support is more important than ever before because I’ll be on the ballot this November. I hope you’ll contribute if you can.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
DONATE $15
DONATE $25
DONATE $50
DONATE $100
DONATE ANOTHER AMOUNT

=========================================   Friend — going to keep this short. 
I don’t like to let others do the talking for me, but this gets directly to the heart of the choice voters have this year. 
I’m sick and tired of politicians forcing their way into doctors offices. I’m ready to fight these bans in the Senate and make Roe the law of the land. 
But I won’t get there without your support. 
Please: Make a donation to my campaign and help me fight to expand safe and legal access to abortion for anyone who needs it.

=========================================Jenga, I'm reaching out one last time today. Since we launched our brand-new TV ad, the response from Ohioans has been incredible. I'm now more hopeful than ever that we can keep this seat and the Senate blue.
But here's the deal: With polls showing me statistically tied with my GOP opponents, we need to reach as many voters as possible with our pro-worker message to pull ahead and win. But with time running out before the midnight deadline, we're still falling short of what we need to share our ad far and wide.
That's why I need to ask one more time: Will you give $5 right now to help us keep our ads on the air, win in Ohio, and keep the Senate blue?

=========================================Jenga, our Senate majority is on the line this fall — and everything that we care about is at stake:
+ The state of reproductive rights and abortion access across the entire country.
+ The future of Social Security, Medicare and other key protections for seniors.
+ Our chance to end the gun violence epidemic and pass meaningful, commonsense reforms.
+ And so much more, from safeguarding LGBTQ+ rights to lowering health care costs to protecting our democracy from GOP extremists.
Kirsten Gillibrand is fighting tooth and nail to defend our Senate majority so that we can continue to win progress on the issues that matter most. But she's facing a tough reelection battle: New York Republicans just had their best election cycle in decades in 2022. Now, they're more emboldened than ever before, and they're directly targeting her seat. 
Kirsten needs a strong grassroots team to fight back against GOP attacks, but right now she's still $8,862 short of her $50,000 end-of-month goal! Please, with so much on the line this year, will you rush $5 to help Kirsten defeat her opponent, defend her must-win seat and save our Senate majority?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

This is it, team. 
This is your last chance to contribute to Ruben’s campaign before our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of the year. And with just a few hours to go, we’re still short. JUST short. 
But we’ve made a LOT of progress.  
Take a look:
We’re close enough now that your donation could be the one that puts us over the top. Seriously. 
So please — PLEASE — rush a donation of $5 or anything you can afford before our deadline hits at midnight. The first deadline of the election year is incredibly important, and we really can’t miss our goal tonight.

=========================================Jenga, you need to see this poll out of Ohio's battleground Senate race:
🔵 Sherrod Brown: 45% 
🔴 GOP Opponents: 44%
This grassroots movement's dedication is paying off in spades. A recent poll shows Sherrod pulling ahead of his GOP opponents! But now that Republicans see our success, they're getting ready to spend BIG to turn the tides against us. 
A Trump-backed group already launched misleading attack ads to smear Sherrod on TV, and now our self-funding opponents are writing themselves million-dollar checks to try to buy this seat.
If Republicans win in Ohio, they know they can flip the Senate red, so they're pulling out all the stops to defeat Sherrod. To make sure we have the resources to fight back, we've set a goal to raise $250,000 by our end-of-month deadline – but with it quickly approaching, we're still falling short.
So please, will you chip in $5 right now so that Sherrod can fight back against GOP attacks, win this race, and keep the Senate blue?

Please read on for a personal message from Sen. Sherrod Brown: Jenga – thank you for being a part of our grassroots movement and for sharing our commitment to the Dignity of Work.
									Fighting for workers means building an economy that prioritizes the needs of workers over tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. No matter who you are or what kind of work you do, I promise to fight for you. But I need your help: Experts say I'm one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection and Senate control could come down to Ohio. The only way we can defend this critical seat is with grassroots contributions from supporters like you.
If you're with me in this fight, please chip in any amount today to win in Ohio and defend our Democratic Senate majority. If you’d like to become one of my TOP supporters and receive exclusive updates from our campaign team, text “OH” to 44105.
									Thank you!

Jenga, it’s Roland Gutierrez.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
I wanted to make sure you the latest news: An exciting new poll just revealed that I’m the Democrat best positioned to defeat Ted Cruz this November:

Jenga, we need to build on this momentum now if we want to win this election, defeat Ted Cruz, and finally flip Texas blue. Can I count on you to help build in our progress by chipping in $10, $15, or even $25 right away? [http://secure.actblue.com/donate/rg2024-em]      
Jenga, I won’t deny it: Defeating Ted Cruz won’t be easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The pundits will count us out. The pollsters will tell us we don’t have a chance. The powerbrokers in DC will act like Ted Cruz has won this race before it’s even begun.                                                                                                                           
But I know we have what it takes to prove them all wrong, Jenga.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
If we stand together and continue building on our momentum, we can prove to the world that a Democrat can win in Texas — and finally end Ted Cruz’s disgraceful career.                                                                                                                             
That’s why I’m asking for your help today, Jenga. If you can spare even just $10, I’d be so grateful. We can’t let this unprecedented opportunity to build on our momentum and win this race go to waste. >> [http://secure.actblue.com/donate/rg2024-em]

You’re receiving this message because of your past support of Democratic candidates and causes. Roland Gutierrez is running to defeat Ted Cruz for Senate. We need your support to elect Roland, but if you’d prefer not to receive emails from our campaign, you can unsubscribe.
Jenga, it’s Roland Gutierrez.
						I wanted to make sure you the latest news: An exciting new poll just revealed that I’m the Democrat best positioned to defeat Ted Cruz this November:
Jenga, we need to build on this momentum now if we want to win this election, defeat Ted Cruz, and finally flip Texas blue. Can I count on you to help build in our progress by chipping in $10, $15, or even $25 right away?
						Jenga, I won’t deny it: Defeating Ted Cruz won’t be easy.
						The pundits will count us out. The pollsters will tell us we don’t have a chance. The powerbrokers in DC will act like Ted Cruz has won this race before it’s even begun.
But I know we have what it takes to prove them all wrong, Jenga.
						If we stand together and continue building on our momentum, we can prove to the world that a Democrat can win in Texas — and finally end Ted Cruz’s disgraceful career.
That’s why I’m asking for your help today, Jenga. If you can spare even just $10, I’d be so grateful. We can’t let this unprecedented opportunity to build on our momentum and win this race go to waste. >>

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

Gloria Johnson is running for the U.S. Senate because Tennesseans deserve leaders who care. 
For too long, elected officials like Marsha Blackburn have done absolutely nothing to make Tennesseans’ lives better. The only interests they’ve cared about are special interests. The only people they’ve championed are their donors.
Gloria will advocate for real solutions to protect our communities from gun violence, make health care more affordable and accessible for all of us, secure access to the ballot box, and defend reproductive rights.

   Jenga, this
   week, I didn’t have Wi-Fi on my Spirit Airlines flight, and I missed an
   important message about Sen. Barbara Boxer’s endorsement from my team.
   They wanted me to write to you about it immediately, but I was in the air
   and had to wait until my flight landed.

   It’s all because I don’t take a single one of your contributions or your
   support for granted. Not ever.
   We’re going to stretch every grassroots dollar to the absolute extreme to
   make the most of your support and win this race.
   Even when it means flying ultra-low-cost, budget airlines like Spirit.
   My team is putting as many of your generous contributions toward voter
   outreach as possible. And to give you a peek behind the curtains — the few
   hundred dollars we save with me flying cheap can help us reach another
   thousand voters or two. With just 29 days left until our primary, it all
   adds up.

=========================================Folks – it’s James Carville. 
I’ll tell it like it is: Democrats are in BIG trouble.
I’ve been in politics for a long time, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a map as tough as ours this year. We’re defending the most delicate Senate majority I’ve ever seen – and Mitch McConnell and his extremist cronies are bound to use every trick up their sleeves to snatch back control.
The GOP is coming at us with full force, and they’re going ALL IN on Nevada as a top target – because they know this battleground is key to Senate control. And with polling already showing Jacky Rosen locked in a dead heat, it’s not looking good.
Nevada is a must-win seat to protect the Senate again in 2024, but Jacky is falling behind her end-of-month fundraising goal, so can you please chip in $5 ASAP?
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_january_2024?refcode=jtk3400-fr-text&amounts=5,25,50,100,250
Democrats barely won in the Silver State by a slim 7,928 votes last year, the closest Senate race in the country – so you can bet that Mitch McConnell and his far-right posse have a bone to pick. They have a massive, dark-money war chest behind them and are gearing up to drop millions and millions of dollars attacking Jacky’s reputation.
The stakes couldn’t be more clear. If Jacky Rosen loses in Nevada, Mitch McConnell and GOP extremists will take back the majority and make it their TOP priority to strip away our basic rights and pass a nationwide abortion ban. 
But it’s not all doom and gloom, friend. In my expert opinion, we can win this race and keep control of the Senate. That starts with raising the resources to prepare for the tough fight ahead of us.
So, ahead of Jacky’s first end-of-month deadline of 2024, I’m begging: Will you please join me and rush $5 so we can win this pivotal battleground state?

=========================================Jenga, I want to personally thank you for always standing with me as we take on the toughest fights in Washington.
Thank you for having my back when we fought for health care coverage for 9/11 first responders and expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. We must ensure that our heroes get the care that they need.
Thank you for supporting my hard-won legislation that empowers survivors of sexual assault in the military to seek justice. Together, we took on the Pentagon to win reforms that will create a fairer system for service members.
Thank you for never giving up the fight to make gun trafficking a federal crime. After 14 years of advocacy, late nights and whipping votes, my legislation was finally passed in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Already, we're stopping the flow of illegal guns into New York.
Thank you for your continued commitment to family rights and gender equity. With your support, I have spent the last decade fighting for national paid family leave for all workers. And now, I'm proud to lead the charge to add the Equal Rights Amendment to our Constitution — which would finally give us the legal basis to restore reproductive rights across the country. 
My record is about winning real results for the families I swore to serve — not for corporations or megadonors. And none of that would be possible without your continued, tireless support.
But here's the bad news: Republicans are emboldened after their historic victories in New York in 2022. Now, they're laying the groundwork for an even bigger red wave in 2024 — and they're directly targeting my seat. I refuse to accept a single cent from corporate PACs, so I'm relying on grassroots donors like you to compete with their right-wing megadonors.
Please, Jenga, you've stood by me so many times before, and I'm counting on you to have my back again. Will you chip in before midnight tonight to join me in this fight for progress and defend our Senate majority? Your support would mean so much to me.

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 – and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

   Hi Jenga — Ben Wikler here from the Democratic Party of
   Wisconsin.
   Wisconsin is home to some of the most competitive elections in the country
   — and Tammy Baldwin’s reelection race this year is shaping up to be no
   different.
   Last month, Senate Republicans threw their support behind Eric Hovde, the
   right-wing megamillionaire who is gearing up to enter Wisconsin’s Senate
   race.
   As soon as he launches his campaign, he’ll bring with him a campaign war
   chest fueled by at least $20 million of his own personal fortune. That’s
   the kind of cash that can tilt the scales when elections are won and lost
   by less than a percentage point.
   I know this campaign has what it takes to reelect Tammy Baldwin, defeat
   Eric Hovde, and keep Wisconsin blue. But we need to start building
   resources now to prepare to compete against Hovde’s cash advantage — so
   Tammy’s campaign can reach voters, fight back against Republican attacks,
   and mobilize Democrats across the state.
   None of that can happen without your support, which is why I’m reaching
   out to you today:
   [ https://act.tammybaldwin.com/go/2155?c0=tbe-em-jan24.HgOSTk&refcode=AU_STB_FR_GEN_EOM_AC_20240130_AM1_V1_S1&t=1005&akid=1928%2E1295058%2EqnFH6c ]Before tomorrow’s end-of-month deadline, will you make a donation to
   Tammy’s campaign to help her keep Wisconsin blue? She can’t defend this
   toss-up Senate seat without your help:

   We’re getting déjà vu with Republicans like Eric Hovde following Ron
   Johnson’s winning strategy from 2010 — when Johnson announced late in the
   cycle to avoid disclosing his personal finances for as long as possible
   and fueled his campaign with his own personal fortune, before defeating
   Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold.
   Together, we have a chance to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself in
   2024.
   Thanks for playing a critical role in Tammy’s campaign.

Hi Jenga — Ben Wikler here from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.
Wisconsin is home to some of the most competitive elections in the country — and Tammy Baldwin’s reelection race this year is shaping up to be no different.
Last month, Senate Republicans threw their support behind Eric Hovde, the right-wing megamillionaire who is gearing up to enter Wisconsin’s Senate race.
As soon as he launches his campaign, he’ll bring with him a campaign war chest fueled by at least $20 million of his own personal fortune. That’s the kind of cash that can tilt the scales when elections are won and lost by less than a percentage point.
I know this campaign has what it takes to reelect Tammy Baldwin, defeat Eric Hovde, and keep Wisconsin blue. But we need to start building resources now to prepare to compete against Hovde’s cash advantage — so Tammy’s campaign can reach voters, fight back against Republican attacks, and mobilize Democrats across the state.
None of that can happen without your support, which is why I’m reaching out to you today: 
Before tomorrow’s end-of-month deadline, will you make a donation to Tammy’s campaign to help her keep Wisconsin blue? She can’t defend this toss-up Senate seat without your help: 
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
CHIP IN $5 NOW
CHIP IN $10 NOW
CHIP IN $25 NOW
CHIP IN $50 NOW
CHIP IN $100 NOW
ANOTHER AMOUNT
We’re getting déjà vu with Republicans like Eric Hovde following Ron Johnson’s winning strategy from 2010 — when Johnson announced late in the cycle to avoid disclosing his personal finances for as long as possible and fueled his campaign with his own personal fortune, before defeating Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold.
Together, we have a chance to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself in 2024.
Thanks for playing a critical role in Tammy’s campaign.
— Ben Wikler

Dear Jenga,
The campaign to Save Virginia and Save America continued this past
week. The Team Emord petition drive is in full swing. Across the
Commonwealth, 160 volunteers trained in the gathering process by our
Petition Director Ann Parker are collecting hundreds of signatures in as
many as six venues simultaneously. It is an incredible sight to behold and
proof that the Emord campaign has the most extensive grassroots support of
any candidate for U.S. Senate.
And Team Emord is everywhere! Join our volunteer force; become part of the
movement to Save Virginia and Save America. Contact Ann Parker at
ann@emordforva.com
This past week, on January 15, Jonathan received an enthusiastic reception
and strong support at the Bell Tower on the Capitol grounds, speaking to
members and supporters of Virginia Medical Freedom Alliance. Endorsed by
the 750,000 strong Stand for Health Freedom, Jonathan pledged to introduce
legislation to ban all mask and vaccine mandates and to compel all
federally funded hospitals, police departments, fire departments, and the
military to rehire and re-enlist those forced out by the mandates, give
them back pay, and the promotions otherwise due them. The speech received
rave reviews and came on the one-year anniversary of his original
announcement of his Emord for Senate exploration from that very same spot.

On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Williamsburg Breakfast Club to an
enthusiastically supportive reception. This is his third appearance before
the Club and members know him well and like him well too.
On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Newport News GOP. Once again, the
support for Emord for Senate was incredible.
On January 17, Jonathan was interviewed by Joe Thomas of WCHV in
Charlottesville. He discussed Kaine’s voting record of support for
inflationary spending, open borders, and woke policies in the
schools. Jonathan explained that Virginia and the nation must reverse
course or face years more of ruin from the Biden/Kaine far left agenda.
On January 17, Jonathan spoke before the Yorktown Breakfast Club. Members
asked questions and Jonathan delighted those in attendance with his
characteristic direct and detailed responses, revealing the breadth of his
understanding, experience, and legal and persuasive skills. Several
mentioned to the Team that they could not wait for Jonathan to debate Kaine.
On January 17, Jonathan signed copies of his books and spoke to patrons at
the Book Owl Bookstore in Portsmouth, Virginia. Members of the public were
intrigued to learn of Jonathan’s agenda and many expressed strong support.
On January 18, Jonathan addressed the Newport Breakfast Club. Once again,
members asked probing questions and enjoyed hearing Jonathan reveal not
only clear mastery of a wide range of subjects but also detailed
legislative solutions to the problems facing the nation. As in each
location before, the support for Emord for Senate is very strong in Newport
News.
On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by Dr. Jason Dean on Brave TV. They
discussed the disastrous open border policy and the union between Biden,
Kaine, and globalists intent on destroying the American republic and
replacing it with a totalitarian global government.
On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show, as
he is every Thursday. They discussed the pressing issues of the day.
﻿On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by TNT Radio on its State of the
Nation live broadcast. Jonathan explained in detail his agenda for saving
Virginia and America and received the on air endorsements of the program’s
two hosts.
On January 18, Jonathan spoke before the Gloucester County Republican
Committee. Members repeatedly advised the campaign of their support for
Emord for Senate as the sweep across Virginia continues.
On January 19, Jonathan was interviewed on Newsmax by host Rob Carson.

Jonathan
explained his position on the J-6ers, reiterating that only those for whom
there is direct evidence of violence or property destruction should be
prosecuted. The vast majority should be immediately released. He explained
that he will introduce legislation to grant immediate release and amnesty
to those wrongfully arrested and incarcerated. No one should be jailed, let
alone placed in solitary confinement, whose only crime may have been
trespass. That is an abuse of prosecutorial discretion and proof that
Justice has been perverted to attack Democrats’ political opponents.
On January 20 and 21, Jonathan joined Team Emord at the Salem Gun Show,
joining them in defending our 2nd Amendment rights. The Team interacted
with hundreds of patrons and strong patriots. Jonathan will sponsor
legislation to establish constitutional carry nationwide to end state and
local efforts to deprive Americans of their right to keep and bear arms.
THE CLOCK IS TICKING
Our campaign to raise $50,000 by the January 31 deadline is underway.
Donate what you can! Help get us past the finish line. Only days left. The
clock is ticking.

Dear Jenga,
The campaign to Save Virginia and Save America continued this past week. The Team Emord petition drive is in full swing. Across the Commonwealth, 160 volunteers trained in the gathering process by our Petition Director Ann Parker are collecting hundreds of signatures in as many as six venues simultaneously. It is an incredible sight to behold and proof that the Emord campaign has the most extensive grassroots support of any candidate for U.S. Senate. 
And Team Emord is everywhere! Join our volunteer force; become part of the movement to Save Virginia and Save America. Contact Ann Parker at ann@emordforva.com
This past week, on January 15, Jonathan received an enthusiastic reception and strong support at the Bell Tower on the Capitol grounds, speaking to members and supporters of Virginia Medical Freedom Alliance. Endorsed by the 750,000 strong Stand for Health Freedom, Jonathan pledged to introduce legislation to ban all mask and vaccine mandates and to compel all federally funded hospitals, police departments, fire departments, and the military to rehire and re-enlist those forced out by the mandates, give them back pay, and the promotions otherwise due them. The speech received rave reviews and came on the one-year anniversary of his original announcement of his Emord for Senate exploration from that very same spot.
  On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Williamsburg Breakfast Club to an enthusiastically supportive reception. This is his third appearance before the Club and members know him well and like him well too.           
On January 16, Jonathan spoke before the Newport News GOP. Once again, the support for Emord for Senate was incredible.
  On January 17, Jonathan was interviewed by Joe Thomas of WCHV in Charlottesville. He discussed Kaine’s voting record of support for inflationary spending, open borders, and woke policies in the schools. Jonathan explained that Virginia and the nation must reverse course or face years more of ruin from the Biden/Kaine far left agenda.        
  On January 17, Jonathan spoke before the Yorktown Breakfast Club. Members asked questions and Jonathan delighted those in attendance with his characteristic direct and detailed responses, revealing the breadth of his understanding, experience, and legal and persuasive skills. Several mentioned to the Team that they could not wait for Jonathan to debate Kaine.        
On January 17, Jonathan signed copies of his books and spoke to patrons at the Book Owl Bookstore in Portsmouth, Virginia. Members of the public were intrigued to learn of Jonathan’s agenda and many expressed strong support.
  On January 18, Jonathan addressed the Newport Breakfast Club. Once again, members asked probing questions and enjoyed hearing Jonathan reveal not only clear mastery of a wide range of subjects but also detailed legislative solutions to the problems facing the nation. As in each location before, the support for Emord for Senate is very strong in Newport News.        
  On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by Dr. Jason Dean on Brave TV. They discussed the disastrous open border policy and the union between Biden, Kaine, and globalists intent on destroying the American republic and replacing it with a totalitarian global government.        
On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show, as he is every Thursday. They discussed the pressing issues of the day.  
﻿On January 18, Jonathan was interviewed by TNT Radio on its State of the Nation live broadcast. Jonathan explained in detail his agenda for saving Virginia and America and received the on air endorsements of the program’s two hosts.
On January 18, Jonathan spoke before the Gloucester County Republican Committee. Members repeatedly advised the campaign of their support for Emord for Senate as the sweep across Virginia continues.
  On January 19, Jonathan was interviewed on Newsmax by host Rob Carson. Jonathan explained his position on the J-6ers, reiterating that only those for whom there is direct evidence of violence or property destruction should be prosecuted. The vast majority should be immediately released. He explained that he will introduce legislation to grant immediate release and amnesty to those wrongfully arrested and incarcerated. No one should be jailed, let alone placed in solitary confinement, whose only crime may have been trespass. That is an abuse of prosecutorial discretion and proof that Justice has been perverted to attack Democrats’ political opponents.

=========================================Thank you for joining our grassroots team, Jenga!
Looking ahead to 2024, Democrats are facing our toughest election map in decades as we fight to defend the Senate — and I'm facing an uphill battle to reelection after New York Republicans secured historic victories in the 2022 midterm elections.
That's why I'm so grateful to have grassroots folks like you by my side. You are the reason we expanded our narrow majority in November, and you will be the reason we protect it again next year. So today, I need to hear from you directly, because we want to keep your thoughts and priorities at the very center of our plans. 
Please, will you take a minute or two to share which issues are top of mind for you right now? Your insights will be critical to building a winning reelection strategy and defending the Senate for Democrats. 
http://surveys.signforgood.com/2024-Welcome-Message-Survey?code=jtk3885-su-text&email=Jengabuilding90@gmail.com&zip=02120
When it comes to getting things done for you and your family, I've never backed down from a tough fight, and I never will. The challenges our country is facing are too urgent — and the stakes are simply too high to sit on the sidelines. There is still so much left to do to address the climate crisis, establish national paid leave, expand access to affordable health care, bolster voting rights and defend reproductive freedom.
But I can't continue these fights without your help: Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says that the GOP has a clear path to retaking the Senate majority, and it’s already targeting my seat after winning races across New York last November.
That's why it's so important that I hear from you today. Please, will you take our brief priorities survey to share your thoughts with me directly?

One day, our kids will ask us, “What did you do to try and Save America?” 
I don’t want to look in their eyes and say, “I gave up because it was too 
hard.”
We don’t have that option; we have one year to save America. Are you up for it?
 <https://secure.karilake.com/27ffbe61-abaa-4a8d-9a5f-07e59a4030e1?amount=25> 
We have to get our priorities right in this country — Americans are suffering, 
and the Biden administration is doing NOTHING.
Every decision I make in the U.S. Senate will be made with our children and 
families in mind. I will answer to YOU, the people of Arizona, NOBODY ELSE.
My radical opponents are only accountable to their real constituents… 
The military-industrial complex, giant corporations, big pharma, big banks, 
WEF, and other GLOBALIST INSTITUTIONS. Don’t let them trick you into thinking 
they care about Arizona. 
It’s time to fight for America First. We’re going to start building up 
America, and I promise I’ll never stop fighting for THE PEOPLE. I need your 
help to make it to Washington; it’s NOW OR NEVER! 
<https://secure.karilake.com/27ffbe61-abaa-4a8d-9a5f-07e59a4030e1?amount=25> 
For the next hour — I need your help. I’m making a MASSIVE push right now, and 
I want to hold my head up high, knowing we did EVERYTHING possible to save the 
nation we LOVE.
I’m asking for 100 DONORS to JOIN MY FIGHT by MIDNIGHT! 
Any contribution RIGHT NOW will make DOUBLE THE IMPACT on my Midnight Deadline 
— ACT NOW AND SAVE AMERICA!

I need your help to make it to Washington; it’s NOW OR NEVER! For the next hour — I need your help. I’m making a MASSIVE push right now, and I want to hold my head up high, knowing we did EVERYTHING possible to save the nation we LOVE. I’m asking for 100 DONORS to JOIN MY FIGHT by MIDNIGHT!

A Note from CAPT Hung Cao USN (Ret)
This week, I was heartbroken to hear that three U.S. troops were killed and 
more than 40 more were injured during a missile strike in Jordan. The Biden 
administration sees our military as pawns, placing them in harms way through 
inept their leadership. These brave Americans have done what Joe Biden and Tim 
Kaine have never done: put their lives on the line for this Republic.
I got into this race to give Virginia the leader it deserves. After seeing 
career politicians on the left ignore the people they claim to represent, I’m 
more convinced than ever that I’ve been called to replace them. Our country is 
in more turmoil than ever and it’s time for a change in Washington.

=========================================Jenga, Kirsten Gillibrand is running for reelection so that she can keep delivering results for families like yours. Here's the latest update on Kirsten and this must-win race.
FIRST: Kirsten announced new legislative efforts to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, restore abortion rights nationwide, pass paid family leave, empower seniors and end government corruption.
THEN: New York Republicans ramped up their attacks on Kirsten! After powering a huge red wave in 2022, they're more determined than ever to defeat Kirsten and flip the Senate red right here in New York.
NOW: Kirsten is facing her first end-of-month goal of 2024, and she's falling $9,447 short with less than 48 hours left! 
GOP extremists are watching Kirsten and her campaign like hawks. At even the smallest sign of weakness, they won't hesitate to flood the airwaves with attacks. 
That's why Kirsten is counting on a surge in grassroots support in the next few hours to get back on track to hit this goal. Please, will you rush $5 or more right now to make sure that Kirsten can defend her must-win seat and continue to deliver progress for families?

A note from Kirsten:
Jenga, I can’t thank you enough for standing by my side in the critical fights ahead of us. As Democrats face our toughest Senate map in decades, I need your help more than ever.
While Republicans only have to defend 10 seats in 2024, Democrats have to defend 23 — and if the GOP flips just two of them, it will deliver Senate control back to Mitch McConnell. Now, experts at FiveThirtyEight are saying that the GOP has a clear path to the majority.
As right-wing special interests gear up to pour millions into flipping the Senate, we need to fight back right now. But I refuse to take a single cent from corporate PACs, which means I’m relying on your grassroots support. So please, chip in to help defend our narrow Democratic Senate majority. And if you’d like to become a core member of my team and receive exclusive texts from my campaign, text JOIN to 60708.
Thank you,
Kirsten Gillibrand

=========================================I’m grateful beyond belief.
Only yesterday, I told you I was in danger of missing my very FIRST End of Month Deadline of 2024.
But my campaign manager just called to tell me that – with only 12 hours left – we are about to pull off an unprecedented comeback.
I only need 2 more gifts from your city in these final hours to reach my critical End of Month goal, fund my campaign to defeat extremist Kevin Cramer, and FLIP this seat for Democrats.
Can I count on you to chip in $15 and help me pull this off before midnight? I don’t accept a cent of Corporate PAC money, which means my campaign relies on everyday folks chipping in whatever they can to hit our goals and win this race. >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240131_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]
I’m running to fight for working and middle-class folks who have been left behind by Kevin Cramer for far too long.
I’m so proud to have a grassroots team behind me that’s just as determined as me to flip this seat and prove once and for all that Cramer’s days voting against our families are numbered.
But, I’m facing the first major test of the election year. Cramer’s corporate donors are watching for any sign of weakness and National Democrats are looking to see if we have enough support to pull off a win.
I need your help to prove that we are a force to be reckoned with and build a campaign we can all be proud of.
I can’t overstate how important this deadline is. So I’m asking one last time: Can I count on you to rush in $15 and help me close this fundraising gap before my first End of Month Deadline of the year hits in 12 hours? >> [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?refcode=20240131_em_fr_b1_katrina_30_cl_v2&amount=15]
